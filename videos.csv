Elements and compounds can exist as pure substances, each with a fixed, definite composition. Some compounds, like water, are made of individual molecules. Others, like salt, form crystals—large, repeating 3D patterns without individual molecules. Additionally, some elements pair up as diatomic molecules, such as O₂ and H₂, rather than existing as single atoms. Understanding whether a substance is molecular or crystalline and how diatomic elements differ from compounds is key to classifying matter.

Some substances, like copper or gold, are pure elements. Others, like water (H₂O), are compounds—made from two or more elements in fixed ratios, chemically bonded. Each compound has a unique formula, like CO₂ for carbon dioxide, representing its specific atomic arrangement. Compounds form molecules, tightly bonded units, creating an incredible diversity of substances in nature.

The periodic table organizes all known elements by atomic number, displaying them in rows and columns called periods and groups. Each element’s square includes its symbol, atomic number, and atomic mass. Groups of elements often share similar properties, like the reactive metals in Group 1, and the inert noble gases in Group 18. The table also separates metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, helping us see patterns in elemental behavior and relationships.

An atom is the smallest particle of an element that still retains all the properties of that element. Early philosophers imagined atoms as indivisible units that make up all matter, an idea revived and developed by scientists like John Dalton. Atoms are incredibly small and numerous—a single gold ring contains more atoms than stars in the universe, highlighting their fundamental role in forming the matter we see.

Dimbin's full shopping cart rant:

Loose shopping carts: are they a sign of moral decline?
The best evidence I have yet encountered that ours is a broken nation, unburdened by the slightest social cohesion, is the fact that I keep tripping over abandoned grocery store shopping carts. A nation is judged by its failings, and while it may seem inconsequential to you, while it may seem petty and unnecessary, I hold that you can tell quite a bit about a country by whether or not its people put their carts away when they've finished grocery shopping. When I see a flock of shopping carts, uncared-for and unloved, clogging the parking lot of my local Sav-a-Bunch, I feel a fury that borders on woe: why don't we care about one another?
Cart abandonment as social contagion
The desire to put away your grocery cart is a socially considerate one, but studies indicate that social disorder is infectious. A 2008 study in the Netherlands found that if you see graffiti in an alleyway, you'll feel more entitled to litter there. If five people haven't put their carts away, you're less likely to put yours away. Not putting away your shopping cart is another kind of social contagion.
Who it hurts
Why is this bad, you might be asking? What's the trouble here? Well, shopping carts don't have brakes. They can hit little kids, they can block handicapped spaces, they can damage cars, they can trundle out of the parking lot and into the road, causing car crashes. We've already become so alienated, so remote from our neighbors. Putting your cart away is one of the smallest gestures that indicate we're looking out for one another. Additionally, most grocery stores don't have a clerk on ""cart duty"" to reclaim wayward carts. Cashiers and stockists go on forays to gather shopping carts from where responsible shoppers have corralled them, and every extra moment those workers have to spend collecting the carts that have been strewn around the lot is another moment they can't spend helping customers make purchases. Not putting your cart away contributes to longer lines at the grocery store. Those stores that do have cart-wranglers certainly don't appreciate having to hunt down wayward carts, and worse, can sometimes have carts shoved at them by unruly shoppers. Is that the sort of society we want to have?
Legitimate reasons to abandon your cart
Now I recognize that there are several legitimate reasons why a person might not be able to return a shopping cart easily. Perhaps you've got lots of children and can't wrangle the kids and the groceries by themselves. Perhaps you have a physical disability and can't return the cart on your own. … But the fact that a minority of people cannot return carts means that the rest of us, as a SOCIETY, must support you and fill in the gaps. If you see an orphaned shopping cart, return it to the cart corral, and go on being a productive member of society.

https://www.khanacademy.org/science/hs-chemistry/x2613d8165d88df5e:stoichiometry-and-the-mole/x2613d8165d88df5e:moles-and-molar-mass/v/calculations-using-avogadro-s-number-part-1

Atomic mass units (a.m.u.) are much smaller than grams and are used to measure atomic-scale masses. Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10²³) represents the quantity of particles in one mole, linking atomic masses to measurable amounts in grams. Molar mass, expressed in grams per mole, bridges these concepts, enabling the conversion between the mass of a substance and the amount in moles.

Sections:
00:00 - Introduction
00:25 - What is an Atomic mass unit (amu or u)
04:20 - Avogadro's number and the mole
08:12 - Molar mass
10:28 - Calculating the number of atoms in a sample

Double replacement reactions occur when two compounds exchange ions, forming two new compounds. The driving force in these reactions is often the formation of a precipitate, a gas, or water. A solubility chart is commonly used to predict whether a potential product will be insoluble and therefore precipitate out of solution. This allows us to determine if the reaction will actually occur.

Sections:
00:00 - Experimenting with aqueous NaCl and AgNO3
01:13 - Visual explanation of a double replacement reaction
03:13 - Are double replacement reactions also redox reactions?
04:21 - Driving force in double replacement reactions - precipitation 
05:42 - General form of double displacement reactions

When one element replaces another element in a compound, we call it a single replacement reaction. In these reactions, one atom loses electrons (oxidation) while another element gains those electrons (reduction), making them a form of a redox reaction. Learn to use the Activity Series, which ranks elements by their reactivity and helps predict if the reaction will occur.

Sections:

00:38 - Copper in silver nitrate 
01:22 - What is single replacement rxn?
01:58 - What causes single replacement rxn?

Cash is one of the oldest and most straightforward payment methods, where consumers simply exchange physical currency for goods or services. Credit cards allow people to buy now and pay later, using a line of credit that can be paid off in installments. Other options, such as layaway, rent-to-own, and installment plans, let consumers reserve or receive an item immediately, but pay for it over time.

An oxidation/reduction reaction (also known as a ""redox"" reaction) involves the transfer of electrons. The first definition of oxidation was indeed about oxygen, and meant that an element or compound gained oxygen atoms. However, we eventually came to understand that these chemical reactions frequently involved a transfer of electrons. When an atom loses electrons, it is oxidized. The atom that gains electrons is said to be reduced.

Dilution is the process of lowering the concentration of a solution by adding solvent. This process is important for preparing solutions of precise concentrations for experiments. The dilution equation (M1*V1) = (M2*V2) is used to calculate the molarities and volumes required for the dilution. This often starts with a concentrated stock solution, which is then diluted to achieve the desired concentration for various experiments.

Choosing the smallest monthly payment for your car loan might seem like a good deal at first, but it usually means you'll end up paying a lot more in interest over time. Plus, it could put you in a spot where you owe more than what the car is actually worth, making it hard if you want to sell or trade it in later.

If the same amount of heat flows into (or out of) equal masses of different substances, their temperatures may not change by the same amount. Specific heat capacity (c) tells us how much heat energy is required to change one unit mass of a substance by one unit of temperature. Specific heat is related to heat (q), the mass of the sample (m), and the change in temperature (∆T) by the equation q=cm∆T.

Sections:
00:00 - Introduction
02:26 - What is specific heat capacity?
04:55 - Specific heat capacity equation
07:30 - Example 1 (Find heat)
09:22 - Example 2 (Find final temperature)
11:42 - Why do substances have different specific heats?
