Compounds and chemical formulas | Middle school chemistry | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36nlbUdRvUM,"- [Lecturer] Almost all
the matter in the universe is made from a few, about
100 different elements, kind of like how all the English words and sentences in all the books and poems are made from just 26 letters, and of course, some spaces. But what I love about this analogy is we can take it one step further. Just like how letters can
combine in interesting ways to form lots and lots of words, these elements can combine
in some interesting ways to form substances,
what we call compounds, and that's what we wanna
talk about in this video. Well, first things first,
how did we figure out that elements can combine
to form compounds? Well, when we took naturally
occurring substances with metals in them, which
we call ores, for example, cinnabar is an ore because it contains mercury metal in it. And when we heated it, we were
able to extract that metal, we were able to get that metal, so we were able to get
the mercury out of it, and some other substances as well. From this, we were able to guess that, hey, look, cinnabar is
made from the combination of different elements. So cinnabar is probably your compound. And there are other examples. For example, if you take the ore of gold, which we call calaverite Yeah, these ores have very fancy names. Then if you heat that up, we will be able to extract
metal, the gold out of it and some other elements as well. And again, you can see
therefore calaverite, this ore is a combination
of these elements, and that's how we are able to guess that elements can combine
together to form compounds. And that's also the reason
why the periodic table does not have these compounds, because they are not
fundamentally new elements. These are the elements, and these are formed by
combination of elements. But of course, let's be very concrete now. What exactly are compounds? Well, we define compounds are substances which are made from chemical combinations of two or more different elements. For example, if you look
at water, it's a compound because it's made from
the chemical combination of two elements, hydrogen and oxygen. But what does it mean? What does it mean to say that they are a chemical combination? Well, for that, let's zoom into it. If you could zoom into water and look at the smallest bit of water, then we would see something like this. We would find that one
oxygen atom is combined, it's connected to two
other hydrogen atoms. This is what we call a molecule of water. But what keeps these atoms together? Why are they connected like this? Well, it turns out that
atoms can have a force of attraction between them. And this force of attraction is what we call a chemical bond. Again, don't worry too much about where this chemical bond
comes from and all of that. We'll study more about that
in high school chemistry. But what's important is that
when atoms combine like this, that's what we call as
a chemical combination. And so look, water is
a chemical combination of two or more different elements. And so it's made of billions and trillions of these molecules. Let's take another example. If we consider carbon dioxide, which we usually find in
smoke, then we'll find that it's made of two
elements, carbon and oxygen. And again, if we could zoom into it and look at the smallest
bit of carbon dioxide, this is what we would find. We would again find that look,
one carbon atom is connected to two other oxygen
atoms forming a molecule of carbon dioxide. And again, it's a chemical combination. And that's why carbon
dioxide is a compound. It's called dioxide because
there are two oxygen atoms. Okay, let's take one last example. If you were to look at the
smallest bit of oxygen, you would see something like this. Two oxygen atoms are combined
together to form a molecule. So do you think oxygen is a compound? Well, remember, compounds
require chemical combination of two or more different elements. This is a chemical combination
of the same element, and therefore this is not a compound. Okay, now that we understand
what compounds are, let's finally see how to
write their chemical formulas. So if we go back to water, we saw that oxygen atom is connected to two other hydrogen atoms, right? So guess what? This ratio stays the same. One oxygen atom will always be connected to two other hydrogen atoms when it comes to a water molecule. And so the way we write this is we write the chemical formula as H2O. Notice that the two over here
is written as a subscript, which represents that there are
two hydrogen atoms connected to one oxygen atom. We'll not write it as H2O2, or HO. This would be all wrong. And fun fact, H2O2 is
called hydrogen peroxide, which is poisonous, which is ironic because
H2O, which is water, it gives us life, but add
one more oxygen atom to it, it becomes poisonous. Okay, similarly, if you were
to look at the chemical formula for carbon dioxide, because I have one carbon
attached to two oxygen atoms, and that will always be the
fixed ratio for carbon dioxide. The way we'll write this is CO2. Again, notice we have written
two over here as a subscript because one carbon is
attached to two oxygen atoms. And we can have much bigger molecules. If you have ever put, sugar in lemonade, then you worked with a
molecule called sucrose. It is a big molecule. And let's now look at its
chemical formula, C11H22O11. So this tells us that there are 11 carbon atoms attached to 22 hydrogen atoms,
attached to 11 oxygen atoms. This is one single molecule of sucrose. All right, putting it all together, all matter in this universe is made from a few, about
100 different elements. And when these different elements combine together chemically, we get compounds. The ratio of the elements is always fixed in these compounds, and that's represented by
these chemical formulae. And these compounds can be
represented by these molecules, which act like a single unit over here.",Definition of Compounds,Compounds are substances formed by the chemical combination of two or more different elements.,00:00:00 - 00:05:20,2025-01-29T08:00:03Z,5431,158,0

The periodic table | Middle school chemistry | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg3Fo4WD8XE,"- [Instructor] Almost all
the matter in the universe from the tiniest microbes to the biggest stars in the universe, are made from a few about
100 different elements, which we arrange this
way in a table called the periodic table. But wait a second, why are
they arranged like this and why do they have these colors? And if you were to zoom into it, you can see these different numbers. What do they represent? Well, let's find out. First and foremost these
elements have symbols, right? H for hydrogen, He for helium. Well, turns out these
symbols are universal, and that's pretty cool,
which means if you're to look at this Chinese
periodic table, look, the symbols stay the same. It's in Latin H for
hydrogen, He for helium. Similar is the case for this
periodic table in Hindi, one of the Indian languages. So of course the elements
have different names in Hindi for iron we call loha. But the the important thing is that the symbol stays the same. So the symbols are universal. But the next question is, what exactly are the numbers over here? There are two, right? Let's start with the number on the top. So it starts with one for
hydrogen and then two for helium. And then if you zoom
in, three for lithium, four for beryllium,
and so on and so forth. Well, these numbers are identification numbers of these elements. And we u name to it, we
call it the atomic number. So for example, if I say the
element with atomic number 22, well that's always going to be titanium, element with atomic number five
is always going to be boron. And so these are integers,
they are continuous. And the last element has
the atomic number 118, which is called Oganesson. Fun fact elements up to uranium, which has the atomic number
92 are naturally occurring, but the elements after that
are pretty much synthesized in labs as far as we know. They do not occur in nature. But what about the second number? Well, that's called the atomic mass and it tells us how massive this element
is compared to hydrogen. Again, just to give us some examples, if you look at hydrogen's
atomic mass, it's 1.008 right, now that is in some unit
called the atomic mass unit. Don't worry too much about that. But now if you look at helium, it's atomic mass is 4.003. This means an atom of helium
is about four times more massive compared to the atom of hydrogen. That's the meaning of atomic mass. The atom of gold is about 1.97
times more massive compared to hydrogen and so on and so forth. Now, one technical detail is that this number is in average value. So this is actually an
average atomic mass. And the reason for that is because these elements can have variance. For example, not all the
gold atoms will have the exact same mass. Some will be slightly
more massive science, some will be slightly less massive. And so this number here
represents the average value. This would be true for
all the other elements. They have variance. And these variance are called isotopes. And we'll learn more about
them in high school chemistry. Don't worry too much about it right now. All right, the next question is, what's the deal with these colors? Well, the colors helps us
categorize the elements into three categories. The pink ones are called metals. The blue ones are called non-metals. And what about these green ones over here? Well even kind of think they're
someone somewhat in between. And so we call them metalloids. And yes, the color schemes
are definitely not universal. Different periodic tables
might use different colors. So better way to think about it is we, we draw a zigzag line over here, and all the elements to the left of this zigzag would be metals. And the elements to the
right would be non-metals. And these elements which
are in between over here, those are the metalloids. And of course, this
distinction doesn't make sense for these extremely heavy elements that we synthesize in labs. Okay, anyways, this brings us to the most important thing now, and that is the structure
of this periodic table. If you count the horizontal rows, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 horizontal rows, right? These horizontal rows are what we call the periods
of the periodic table. And similarly, if you're to
look at the vertical columns, you'll see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Okay, let's just wait. Should wait, 18. There are 18 vertical columns, and these are called the
groups of the periodic table. So let's look at them a
little bit more closely. So this basically means that
if I look at this element, say chromium, it belongs
to period four groups six. If you look at carbon,
it belongs to period two, group 14, and so on and so forth. What about these elements? Well, if you look at the atomic
number carefully, it starts with 57 and you can see
57 to 70s over here. So these actually belong to period six, and this belongs to period seven. So it's not like a new period. Okay? But what's interesting for
us is the groups elements that belong to the same group tend to have similar properties. And that's why some of
these groups have names. For example, elements belonging to group one are called alkaline metals. Elements belonging to group two are called Alkaline Earth Metals. Group 17 elements like fluorine, chlorine, and all they're called halogens. And group 18 are called the noble gases. For example, these elements in group one, the alkaline metals, they're
all soft and squishy. I mean, look at this. This is sodium. You can cut it like this. It's kind of like clay. They also have silvery color and they have very low melting points. And their behaviors are
similar in chemical reactions. For example, if you were
to put them in water, they all react violently. Look at that. Another example, group 11 elements like
copper, silver, and gold. They're all metals and
they're all very shiny and super hard. They are malleable, which
means they can be hammered into shapes and ductile, which means they can also
be pulled into wires. And if you look at group
17 elements, the halogens like fluorine, chlorine and so on, t hey are quite chemically reactive. So in the natural form,
they can be dangerous, but they all form salts
as chemical reaction. That's why they're called halogens. Halogens literally means salt formers. And you might know about
some of these salts, sodium chloride for example, table salt, which we all consume. But guess what? Sodium iodide is also a salt. Sodium fluoride is also a salt,
which is used in toothpaste because they can help prevent decays, but halogens can also
kill germs and bacteria, and therefore they're also found in a lot of sanitizers like bleach,
swimming pool chlorine, and other stuff. And as a final example, if
you look at noble gases, the group 18 elements, well, first of all, they're all gases, but more importantly, they
pretty much resist chemical reactions altogether, and they're found in tiny
amounts in our atmosphere. And if you put these gases in glass tubes and passive electricity
through them, they will glow. Yes, neon lights. Well, of course not
everything that glows is neon. Different elements can
have different colors, but that's pretty much it. So to summarize, elements
have the atomic number, which is the ID and the atomic mass number that tells you how massive it is compared to hydrogen. They're arranged in seven horizontal rows, which are called the periods, and the vertical columns
you are called, the groups and elements that belong to the same groups have
similar properties.",Universal Element Symbols,"Element symbols in the periodic table are universal, meaning they are the same in different languages.",00:00:00 - 00:02:20,2025-01-22T08:00:15Z,9658,259,0
The periodic table | Middle school chemistry | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg3Fo4WD8XE,"- [Instructor] Almost all
the matter in the universe from the tiniest microbes to the biggest stars in the universe, are made from a few about
100 different elements, which we arrange this
way in a table called the periodic table. But wait a second, why are
they arranged like this and why do they have these colors? And if you were to zoom into it, you can see these different numbers. What do they represent? Well, let's find out. First and foremost these
elements have symbols, right? H for hydrogen, He for helium. Well, turns out these
symbols are universal, and that's pretty cool,
which means if you're to look at this Chinese
periodic table, look, the symbols stay the same. It's in Latin H for
hydrogen, He for helium. Similar is the case for this
periodic table in Hindi, one of the Indian languages. So of course the elements
have different names in Hindi for iron we call loha. But the the important thing is that the symbol stays the same. So the symbols are universal. But the next question is, what exactly are the numbers over here? There are two, right? Let's start with the number on the top. So it starts with one for
hydrogen and then two for helium. And then if you zoom
in, three for lithium, four for beryllium,
and so on and so forth. Well, these numbers are identification numbers of these elements. And we u name to it, we
call it the atomic number. So for example, if I say the
element with atomic number 22, well that's always going to be titanium, element with atomic number five
is always going to be boron. And so these are integers,
they are continuous. And the last element has
the atomic number 118, which is called Oganesson. Fun fact elements up to uranium, which has the atomic number
92 are naturally occurring, but the elements after that
are pretty much synthesized in labs as far as we know. They do not occur in nature. But what about the second number? Well, that's called the atomic mass and it tells us how massive this element
is compared to hydrogen. Again, just to give us some examples, if you look at hydrogen's
atomic mass, it's 1.008 right, now that is in some unit
called the atomic mass unit. Don't worry too much about that. But now if you look at helium, it's atomic mass is 4.003. This means an atom of helium
is about four times more massive compared to the atom of hydrogen. That's the meaning of atomic mass. The atom of gold is about 1.97
times more massive compared to hydrogen and so on and so forth. Now, one technical detail is that this number is in average value. So this is actually an
average atomic mass. And the reason for that is because these elements can have variance. For example, not all the
gold atoms will have the exact same mass. Some will be slightly
more massive science, some will be slightly less massive. And so this number here
represents the average value. This would be true for
all the other elements. They have variance. And these variance are called isotopes. And we'll learn more about
them in high school chemistry. Don't worry too much about it right now. All right, the next question is, what's the deal with these colors? Well, the colors helps us
categorize the elements into three categories. The pink ones are called metals. The blue ones are called non-metals. And what about these green ones over here? Well even kind of think they're
someone somewhat in between. And so we call them metalloids. And yes, the color schemes
are definitely not universal. Different periodic tables
might use different colors. So better way to think about it is we, we draw a zigzag line over here, and all the elements to the left of this zigzag would be metals. And the elements to the
right would be non-metals. And these elements which
are in between over here, those are the metalloids. And of course, this
distinction doesn't make sense for these extremely heavy elements that we synthesize in labs. Okay, anyways, this brings us to the most important thing now, and that is the structure
of this periodic table. If you count the horizontal rows, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 horizontal rows, right? These horizontal rows are what we call the periods
of the periodic table. And similarly, if you're to
look at the vertical columns, you'll see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Okay, let's just wait. Should wait, 18. There are 18 vertical columns, and these are called the
groups of the periodic table. So let's look at them a
little bit more closely. So this basically means that
if I look at this element, say chromium, it belongs
to period four groups six. If you look at carbon,
it belongs to period two, group 14, and so on and so forth. What about these elements? Well, if you look at the atomic
number carefully, it starts with 57 and you can see
57 to 70s over here. So these actually belong to period six, and this belongs to period seven. So it's not like a new period. Okay? But what's interesting for

Rhetorical devices and appeals | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4ODg51XNYk,"- [David] Hello, readers. I wanna talk to you about
rhetoric, the art of persuasion. Everyone's got a point of view, right? But if I've got a perspective and I've got an argument
that I wanna advance from that perspective, how do I do it? Understanding the tools of persuasion will not only give you the power to craft effective arguments, but it'll also give you
the power to break down and analyze the arguments of others. In this video, I'll cover both rhetorical
devices and appeals. And maybe you've heard of
these and maybe you haven't, and that's fine. Let's get started with figures of speech. Now, we call these figures
of speech rhetorical devices, because they are
essentially simple machines that make meaning. Comparison is a rhetorical device, which means that similes and metaphors are rhetorical devices. ""She was as clever as a fox. He was a demon on the basketball court."" We're using these improbable
comparisons to make a point. She was very clever, he was an unbelievably ferocious player. These people were not literally
foxes or demons or whatnot, but the comparison helps
drive home the writer's point. Hyperbole or overstatement is also a pretty common rhetorical device. ""My dad makes the best
enchiladas in the galaxy."" Are they literally the best enchiladas? Who can say, that's so subjective. But the writer is trying
to indicate that they think their dad makes really
spectacular enchiladas. That's what I think a
galactic enchiladas look like, they got Hatch Chile
sauce and Saturn's rings, you know, for a little extra kick. It's valuable to recognize
rhetorical devices to understand when they're being used. It makes you both a stronger
writer and a stronger reader. Are there obscure ones? Sure, tons of them. I'm not gonna tell you
to remember apophasis, which is the rhetorical device where you call attention to something by saying you won't mention it, which is what I did just now. Even if you don't know the names of the more obscure devices, you may be able to pick up
on the persuasive strategies that an author is using. Those are examples of devices, and they're relatively easy to identify. What can be tougher to
identify at a glance are rhetorical appeals where the language of a
given part of the text is meant to appeal to a
different kind of thinking, logic, authority, emotion. Let's start with the first one,
appeals to logic are logos. A bar graph is an appeal to logos, use of statistics is an appeal to logos. Appeals to emotion use pathos. I might call a puppy crying
in the rain pathetic, because I feel pity
imagining such a thing. ""Oh, look at him. Don't you wanna support your
local animal shelter now? The animal shelter near my hometown is called Orphans of the Storm, which, come on, you don't
wanna save the orphan puppy?"" Pathos. Appeals to authority fall under ethos. ""Hey, you can trust me, I'm important. I know what I'm talking
about, I have a radio voice."" This video itself is on Khan Academy, a trusted nonprofit brand for education. There's a kind of inherent appeal to ethos in every KA video, article, or exercise. We're hoping that you trust us to teach you something, right? There's a little bust of me, David, trusted educator, hopefully. That's a basic primer on
rhetorical devices and appeals, those elements of writing and speech that make your arguments more
persuasive and compelling. Remember the three rhetorical appeals, logos is logical, pathos is emotions, and ethos is authority. I hope that I, your efficacious, cheery, and well-vetted instructor
have driven home for you that with the power of rhetoric, not only can you convince
anyone of anything, you can learn anything too. David out. Oh, man, is my catchphrase itself a repeated rhetorical device? I think it is. What's its effect? Discuss amongst yourselves.

Supporting an inference with logical reasoning and evidence | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFmtXeKPId4,"- [Instructor] Hello readers. Let's play detective, shall we? My mama always told me not
to jump to conclusions, but that's essentially what
the skill of inference is. It's not really a guess. It's combining what you already know with what's in front of you and drawing conclusions from there. It's filling in the gaps. So look, I can look at
this shape with gaps in it, and based on what the shape suggest and based on what I already know, I can say I'm pretty
sure that's an elephant. When I do that, I'm making an inference. That's what we're gonna
talk about in this video. Not just making an inference, but going back and supporting that inference with evidence. This is an essential skill. Knowing how to read between the lines can help you make sense of
what's missing in a text, of what's being left unsaid, or maybe even to figure
out if someone is lying. Let me set up an example, a
little locked room mystery. There was a mouse hole
in the wall of a kitchen. There is a heavy glass jar
full of lovingly baked cookies with a heavy glass lid still on the jar. An hour ago, there were
a dozen cookies in there, and now there are only six. From the jar across the floor to the mouse hole in the wall, there is a trail of cookie crumbs. The question readers is, therefore, who took the cookies? The answer is not a mouse. A mouse did not take the cookies. It's a things to set up. It's a frame job. How do I know that? The lid. Based on my background
knowledge about mice, I don't think a mouse
would've been able to lift and replace the heavy
glass lid of the jar. Maybe if we knew a person
had left the lid off the jar, the mouse would still be a suspect. But I can infer from the evidence I see and my background knowledge that someone else took six cookies and left it incriminating
cookie crumb trail that led to the doorstep
of an innocent mouse. And when I am defending
this mouse in court, I will point to the lid as evidence in support of my inference. Let's do this again. But I'll give you a chunk of text to look at and then you'll get the chance to make your own inferences. Here is the first introduction of Agatha Christie's fictional
detective Hercule Poirot. The narrator describes Poirot. Poirot was an extraordinary
looking little man. He was hardly more than
five feet, four inches, but carried himself with a great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched
it a little on one side. His mustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of his attire
was almost incredible. I believe the speck of
dust would've caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet, as a detective, his
flare had been extraordinary, and he had achieved
triumphs by unraveling some of the most baffling cases of the day. And for you, I have a
question now, readers. Based on this description, what personality traits
do you think Poirot has that make him good
at solving mysteries? I'll put on some music, or you can take this time to
pause the video and discuss. We'll meet back here and I'll show you how to answer this question by making some informed inferences. (upbeat music) Okay, let's go through it. So what traits does
Poirot have that make him good at solving mysteries? I think the words I'd
use to describe Poirot are fussy or detail-oriented. How do I know that? Let's go to the text. He carries himself with great dignity. He's proud of his appearance. He has this stiff little mustache. ""The neatness of his attire was almost incredible."" That is to say, literally
incredible, unbelievable. His clothes were so neat, unbelievably so to the point where a speck of dust would hurt him like a bullet hurt someone. All those details lead me to conclude that he notices little things. You have to notice the little things if you're going to keep yourself so neat. So exquisitely tidy and free of dust, a spectacular attention to detail. I can infer that that's
the personality trait that leads him to notice things other people wouldn't notice, and makes him such a great detective. As you read, it's
important to keep checking for text evidence that supports or discredits your initial inferences. Sometimes they'll be
wrong, sometimes right. But usually the rest of the text will help you determine that. Now, do I suspect that
you or I or any of us are likely to become
mystery solving sleuths? Well, yes, actually I do. I just think it'll be through the skill of inference in your reading practice and not through solving murders.

to jump to conclusions, but that's essentially what
the skill of inference is. It's not really a guess. It's combining what you already know with what's in front of you and drawing conclusions from there. It's filling in the gaps. So look, I can look at
this shape with gaps in it, and based on what the shape suggest and based on what I already know, I can say I'm pretty

talk about in this video. Not just making an inference, but going back and supporting that inference with evidence. This is an essential skill. Knowing how to read between the lines can help you make sense of
what's missing in a text, of what's being left unsaid, or maybe even to figure
out if someone is lying. Let me set up an example, a
little locked room mystery. There was a mouse hole
in the wall of a kitchen. There is a heavy glass jar
full of lovingly baked cookies with a heavy glass lid still on the jar. An hour ago, there were
a dozen cookies in there, and now there are only six. From the jar across the floor to the mouse hole in the wall, there is a trail of cookie crumbs.

ancient, first, long ago, and logy means science or the study of. You might also see it in

science, an archeologist, goes on trips to the place they study, and there they carefully dig up artifacts and then they take those
artifacts to a museum or a university and they study them, and they try to learn
things about the culture that produced those artifacts, right? I could find ancient pottery

to stay with the times, how to remain relevant in this, our rapidly changing world,
appropriately enough, the word we're talking about
in this video is contemporary. It's an adjective, it means
dealing with the present day or existing at the same time. And weirdly, when I think about this word, I think about a song from
the 1950s, Design for Living by the English musical
duo, Flanders and Swann, where they talk about
their lovely little house that is so stylish and up to date that they can't live in it. We're terribly house
and garden at number 7B, we live in a most amusing muse,
ever so very contemporary. And then they go on to talk about how the garden's full of furniture, the house full of plants,
et cetera, et cetera. It's very cute. Look it
up, but look it up later. We've got word origins to explore. It's a pretty straightforward etymology, a pretty straightforward word origin for contemporary. Con means together in Latin, and temporary comes from Latin. (speaking in foreign language) Which has to do with time. So con and temp, temp for time. So basically con, temp together
at the same time, right? Contemporary, can you think of some words that use these word parts? The root temp for time and
the prefix con for together? Let me put on some contemporary music. 10 seconds. Here we go, shout them out. (upbeat music) Here are three that I came up with. Temporary meaning for a short time, tempo, which is the speed of music, like beats per minute and
convenient, easy, suitable. I love convenient because it

in a couple of sentences. I love contemporary art, though Jesse sometimes
finds it challenging. Here, I'm using contemporary
to mean modern art or art from now. Let's use contemporary to
mean alive at the same time. It's hard to believe that

Authentic | Vocabulary | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVlFzfHc3t0,"- [David] Wordsmiths, hello. The word I'm going to take apart in this video is ""authentic."" The genuine article, the real deal. It's an adjective. It's describing word and it means what I just
said, genuine, real. Say a painting surfaced out of nowhere and the seller says, I'm
pretty sure this is a painting by Van Gogh or an artist like
him or whoever it might be. Well, the museum that might
wanna buy that painting sure wants to make certain
it's really by a famous artist from a century-and-a-half
ago and not a knockoff the seller painted in
his garage last week. So the museum sends experts
to look at the painting and they poke at the painting, and maybe they sniff the painting and determine its authenticity, whether or not it's authentic,
whether or not it's real. And actually, the authentic pronunciation of Vincent Van Gogh's name in Dutch is something like Vun Khokh. This word's original meaning
was something more like approved or authorized, which is reflected in its Greek origins. Auto means self and hentes means doer. So authentikos is something like, a thing I've done by
myself, or I approved this. With that etymology in mind, what are some other words you can think of when you look at authentic? I'll put on the old record player and give you 10 seconds to
think of some similar words. (happy music) Here are some words I thought of: Author, a person who
has written something, like the author of a book; Authenticate to prove that
something is true or real. Like that art expert from the intro authenticating a painting; And automatic describing a
thing that acts on its own. Like you don't need to turn the crank on an automatic pencil sharpener. Let's use authentic in a few sentences. Horace took his baseball to an expert to prove that its Hank Aaron
signature was authentic. See, you're putting the baseball
up on the scale, which, oh, I gotta put something in there. How much does the baseball
weigh? About five ounces. This is 150 grams. Anyway, I dunno why you
need to weigh a baseball to determine whether or not
its signature is authentic. That doesn't make any sense, but you would probably take it to someone to review the signature and say, ""Oh yeah, that's what Hank
Aaron's signature looked like."" If you want to make
authentic enchilada sauce, you've got to start with
whole dried chilies. Ta-da! That's supposed
to be an ancho chili. What makes something authentic for you? What are those markers of authenticity? Give that a ponder. Why don't you. I remain authentically,
your most obedient servant, et cetera. You can learn anything. David out.",Authenticity in Art,"The video delves into the meaning and importance of authenticity, particularly in the context of art.",00:00:00 - 00:04:00,2025-01-15T13:23:15Z,3232,58,0

its signature is authentic. That doesn't make any sense, but you would probably take it to someone to review the signature and say, ""Oh yeah, that's what Hank
Aaron's signature looked like."" If you want to make

Authentic | Vocabulary | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVlFzfHc3t0,"- [David] Wordsmiths, hello. The word I'm going to take apart in this video is ""authentic."" The genuine article, the real deal. It's an adjective. It's describing word and it means what I just
said, genuine, real. Say a painting surfaced out of nowhere and the seller says, I'm
pretty sure this is a painting by Van Gogh or an artist like
him or whoever it might be. Well, the museum that might
wanna buy that painting sure wants to make certain
it's really by a famous artist from a century-and-a-half
ago and not a knockoff the seller painted in
his garage last week. So the museum sends experts
to look at the painting and they poke at the painting, and maybe they sniff the painting and determine its authenticity, whether or not it's authentic,
whether or not it's real. And actually, the authentic pronunciation of Vincent Van Gogh's name in Dutch is something like Vun Khokh. This word's original meaning
was something more like approved or authorized, which is reflected in its Greek origins. Auto means self and hentes means doer. So authentikos is something like, a thing I've done by
myself, or I approved this. With that etymology in mind, what are some other words you can think of when you look at authentic? I'll put on the old record player and give you 10 seconds to
think of some similar words. (happy music) Here are some words I thought of: Author, a person who
has written something, like the author of a book; Authenticate to prove that
something is true or real. Like that art expert from the intro authenticating a painting; And automatic describing a
thing that acts on its own. Like you don't need to turn the crank on an automatic pencil sharpener. Let's use authentic in a few sentences. Horace took his baseball to an expert to prove that its Hank Aaron

Deception | Vocabulary | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8P_IjvzGPY,"- Hello, wordsmiths. It is I Don Figaro, the charming and mysterious barber who
knows nothing of vocabulary. Did I fool you? I am no Don Figaro at all, but in fact, just regular
David who is not a barber, but I have just engaged in
this video's word, deception. I am certain, you fell for it. You see, to deceive someone
for that's the verb form. Deceive is to trick them. Deception. A noun means a trick, lies. Usually it's a bad thing
unless you want to be deceived, like when you're watching
a stage magician. But otherwise, yeah, if
you're engaging in deception, you are swindling someone,
you are tricking them, you're misleading them. This word comes from the
Latin decipere, to cheat, to take someone in. The prefix de means down or
from and cipere means to take, and the way we see it in
English is usually as cept or cap, a brutal word,
but that makes sense. It's brutally unkind to trick someone. What other words do you see
lurking in those word parts? What are some related words?
I'll put on some music. You take 10 seconds to pull some words out of your magic hats. All right. (upbeat music) Here's a few. I thought of all using that cap or cept, root, intercept
to capture, to grab, admit air capture itself
also comes from cipere. That's a bonus word for you. Capable describing someone
who can do something, who can grasp the idea and follow through and conceive to come up with
something to invent or create. Okay, I'm not going to use
deception in any sentences today. That's the end of the
video. Thanks very much. Ho ho, I have done it again. Long have I practiced
the art of deception. I'm just Josh in here. Let's use deceive or
deception in a few sentences. Oh, false one! You have deceived me! Is a quotation from a very silly play called ""The Pirates of Penzance."" And it is inevitably what I think of when I think of this word. One character has tricked another, and now the character who has been tricked has
a whole song about it. If you deceive someone, they will sing an angry song at you later. That is just a law of musical theater. Another sentence. Disguised as a cactus, the spy was familiar with
the art of deception. You see, she's disguised as a cactus so that she can trick people. Maybe there'll be extra
unguarded around the cactus. Reveal some deep, dark secrets. I apologize for repeatedly tricking you in this video wordsmith. It is unbecoming of me. I will not do it again
unless there is another word about being sneaky and underhanded in which case, yes, I will probably try to deceive you again in my expert fashion, but you'll figure it out. After all, you can learn anything. Don Figaro, out. Oh, boom, got him.

do you see what I see? - [Hannah] Yeah, I see a
bird. But what are you even- - [David] It's a glorious day to learn about the elements of drama. Whispering. One of my favorite subjects. - [Hannah] Why are you
saying the stage directions? - [David] What? - [Hannah] David, you're- - [David] I thought I was
supposed to read the whole thing? - [Hannah] You're not supposed to read the parts in parentheses. - [David] And scene. Readers, hello. Hi, Hannah. - Hi David.
- So, this video is about how to read a play. It's different than
reading a book or a poem. - [Hannah] Plays contain
their own instructions like Ikea furniture, but not instructions for
assembling a desk or whatever. - [David] Nope. - [Hannah] Instructions
for performing the play. - [David] So, there's text
in a play that isn't meant to be read aloud by people on stage during the play, like I was doing. One example of that is
the stage directions. I was only pretending not
to know what they were. - [Hannah] So deceptive. - [David] Ain't I a stinker? But yeah, there will sometimes
be stuff in parentheses under a character's name that suggests how an actor might deliver the line. So, when you've got a character's name in a script like this, followed by a line,
that's called dialogue, it's telling us which
character speaks each line. - [Hannah] This can be
really useful if the tone of the line isn't clear from the text. David, gimme a line
read. Everything's great. - [David] Everything's great. - [Hannah] Same line, but
everything's terrible. - [David] Everything's great. - [Hannah] Let's put up a
chunk of script from my play. - Ooh.
- So we can talk about the divisions of
a play and stage directions. See what it says up top? - [David] ""Act one, scene one."" - [Hannah] Plays are often
divided into acts and scenes. - [David] So Hannah, how would
you describe the difference between an act and a scene? - [Hannah] Well, acts are like big pieces and scenes are little pieces. One act can include many scenes. So, imagine a book that goes, part one, part two, part three. Those are like acts. And the scenes of a play are
like the chapters of that book. Much, much smaller. - [David] So Hannah, like what do you use stage directions for? What are the functions of them in a text? - [Hannah] Yeah. Stage
directions can tell us where a play is set,
who the characters are, and what objects they're interacting with. Read for a bit and then
I'll explain some more. - [David] Okay, here we go. ""Act one, scene one. The drawing room, day. Hannah is delicately placing a vase, a vase, on the mantle piece
in her beachfront manor."" Wow. This version of you is fancy. - [Hannah] What can I say? - [David] ""David enters,
sopping wet, covered from head to toe in seaweed."" Hannah, what is this? - [Hannah] It's called the
creative process, David. - [David] And I guess
we should probably say a mantelpiece is kind of
that shelf above a fireplace. - Yep, that's right.
- So, okay. So, you can use these
stage directions to inform how you set up the scene. And I noticed that you've capitalized all the character names and
all the important nouns. So, now I know which onstage items or props are absolutely
necessary for the scene. The vase, the seaweed. - [Hannah] Yeah. Not everyone
does that, but I like it. - [David] Now, one of the first things you'll see in a play is the cast list, which is sometimes called
(mimics a fanfare trumpet) the dramatis personae. Sometimes. It's Latin, it's ancient. The only reason I bring it up is that you'll see this phrase if you read Shakespeare's plays in school. - [Hannah] It just means the people in the drama, the characters in the play. - [David] So, the last
thing we want to talk about is a concept called Chekhov's gun. - [Hannah] Anton Chekhov, a
beloved Russian playwright, he said, ""If you place a gun
on the mantle piece in act one, it must go off by act three."" Disclaimer, this is a metaphor. - [David] Yeah, it doesn't have to be, in fact, it probably
shouldn't be a literal gun. But this concept basically means that it's satisfying when
you introduce something early in the play, and
then towards the end of the play it becomes important or relevant in a big way. - [Hannah] Hey, hey, David? Remember when I saw a bird
out the window earlier? - [David] Yeah. - [Hannah] It's a lot closer now. (David mimics a crow) - [David] Ah! Giant
bird. Giant bird, panic. Close the window. (Hannah laughing) (David mimics a crow)

have this impression that poetry is kind of
fancy or out of reach, but poetry can help us
understand and express how we feel about the things
that matter most to us. To demonstrate that, I brought
on my colleague, David. Say hi to the people, David. - [David] Hi to the people. Hey, Hannah. - [Hannah] Hey. David, what is poetry? - [David] Fundamentally,
poetry is language art. It's art that plays with the
sound and shape of language. Sometimes it rhymes, the vowel and consonant sounds
match up with each other, and sometimes it doesn't. - [Hannah] Like how
house rhymes with mouse or syllable rhymes with billable? - [David] Billable. - [Hannah] You know, billable hours. Shakespeare's gotta get paid. - [David] I hear that. - [Hannah] So prose, everyday language, the stuff we write and speak normally, using complete sentences
that have no set rhythm. It's usually organized into paragraphs. The equivalent of a paragraph
in poetry is called a stanza, and each stanza is made of lines. - [David] And do those lines
have to be full sentences? - [Hannah] They do not. Think of that William Carlos Williams poem ""This is just to say"". ""This is just to say I have eaten the plums
that were in the icebox an which you are probably
saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were delicious, so sweet and so cold."" - [David] It's like a post-it note poem. Man, you could really make
a poem out of anything. - [Hannah] Yeah. So between I have eaten and the plums, there's a line break. The phrase ""I have eaten the plums"" is broken up across two lines. But on the individual line level, the plums is not a sentence
or even really a clause. It's just some words. - [David] And that's fine for poetry. You don't need to have sentences. - [Hannah] Notice also
that it doesn't rhyme. - [David] And ""I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox"",
those four lines, those make up a stanza. In this poem, every stanza is
the same length, four lines. - [Hannah] Do stanzas
have a standard length? - [David] No, they don't. Stanzas can be any length, and they don't even need
to be the same length in one poem, right? It's more about how the
lines are grouped together and the space between each chunk. Stanzas are a poem chunk. - [Hannah] So, this is
a three-stanza poem, and that's one of the ways you can think about the shape of poetry, how it's broken into stanzas. Another way is through its rhythm. - [David] So, where the
emphasis falls in a word, in the rhythm, we call those stresses. Hannah, let's play ""Name that fruit"". What is that?
- [Hannah] Apple. - [David] Okay, cool. Now, say it slowly. - [Hannah] Apple - [David] Not apple. - [Hannah] No, that sounds
pretty weird to me, David. - [David] Apple.
- [Hannah] Apple. - [David] Apple. So apple is not standard. It's apple. And that's how stresses work. In this word, the first
syllable is stressed, and the second syllable is unstressed. Apple. Doctor. A regular pattern of stresses
in poetry is called meter. - [Hannah] And the most
common meter in English is iambic pentameter. An iamb is unstressed stress. Ta-dah. - [David] Hello. Ta-dah. And penta means five. - [Hannah] Exactly. So it's five of those iambs per line. David, hit me with a little
Shakespeare, won't you? - [David] All right. Sonnet 18. ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate?"" - [Hannah] Ta-dah, ta-dah,
ta-dah, ta-dah, ta-dah. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Five iambs, 10 total syllables. - [David] Iambic pentameter
is really interesting to me because in many ways, it matches the ordinary
rhythms of English speech. Hey Hannah, what you gonna do today? - [Hannah] Hey, hey Hannah,
whatcha gonna do today? - [David] Nice iambic pentameter, but no, I was seriously asking. - [Hannah] Poems don't have to be metered. They don't have to
rhyme. They can just be. - [David] It's true. You may have heard about Japanese haiku and how they have these
syllable requirements, five syllables in the first
line, seven in the second, and five syllables
again in the final line. But to be honest,
especially in translation, it's less about the syllables
and more about the vibe. My favorite haiku that
breaks the syllable rules is this 18th century haiku by Yosa Buson, translated by the
American poet XJ Kennedy. ""On the one-ton temple bell a moon-moth, folded into sleep, sits still. - [Hannah] Whoa, so this
haiku, it's capturing a moment before that bell rings, the moment of quiet before the noise. - [David] Yeah, I think different poems have different functions. It's my belief that haiku
are kinda like photographs. They can capture single moments in time. But my point is like
not just in translation, but even in the original Japanese, that poem doesn't have the quote unquote proper syllable count. So if you're a poet and a rule doesn't serve
your poem, break the rule. - [Hannah] Fascinating stuff. Hey, thanks for coming on

The value of historical context | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbgRHeCOyY,"- [David] Hey, readers. This video is about historical context. Let's get into what that is. Have you ever heard a joke from a friend and you didn't find it very
funny and your friend goes, ""Ah, you had to be there.""? That's historical context. We can't be there, right? It's over. You can't get there from here, pilgrim. Studying historical context allows us to get the joke, as it were. It allows us to understand the environment that a writer was operating in. The political, social, cultural, geographical factors that
all play into how or why someone might be writing
at a particular period. It's like asking your
friend to explain the joke. Historical context helps you
better understand the text. So, with that in mind, I'm going to read you an excerpt from the Autobiography of Frederick Douglass before giving you any historical context. ""I have never approved
the very public manner in which some of our Western friends have conducted what they call
the Underground Railroad, but which, I think, by their open declarations has
been made most emphatically the upperground railroad. I honor those good men and
women for their noble daring. Upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that
those open declarations are a positive evil to
the slaves remaining who are seeking to escape. They do nothing towards
enlightening the slave, whilst they do much towards
enlightening the master. They stimulate him to greater watchfulness and enhance his power
to capture his slave."" So, let's get into this. If you are unfamiliar
with Frederick Douglass, it is my privilege to present him to you, and to give you a little
context on his life. One of America's premier
orators and writers was the honorable Mr. Douglass. The excerpt I just read
came from his 1845 memoir, ""Narrative of the Life
of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave"". Here's some context on Frederick Douglass. He grew up enslaved in Maryland. In 1838, he escaped and
traveled first to New York, and then to Massachusetts,
where slavery was illegal. This helps me understand
where Douglass is coming from. He escaped slavery himself. The network of people, free Black folks, white abolitionists, Quakers, and others who helped
ferry enslaved people along secret routes to freedom, were known collectively as
the Underground Railroad, and it's important to know
that Douglass did not himself use this network to escape slavery. with only a handful of friends, courage and unbelievable good luck, Douglass escaped enslavement. So, what is he getting at in this passage? What's he saying with all this
upperground railroad stuff, and how does the context of his life, how does that context help
us answer these questions? Because it kind of sounds like he's saying he doesn't like the
Underground Railroad, right? He has never approved of it, which if we know anything about Douglass, sounds like it doesn't make sense. Why would a man who slavery himself dislike the Underground Railroad? It's not that he doesn't
like the route to freedom, how could he not? And he says as much, quote, ""I honor those good men and women for their noble daring"", but he doesn't like
their open declarations of what they're doing. He wants it to remain secret. Douglass is approaching this
from a position of empathy with those people who are still enslaved. ""The open discussion of
the Underground Railroad endangers everyone"", he argues. ""Rather than enlightening the slave, it enlightens the master"", he says here. It educates him and makes him aware. If the enslaver is aware that there is a network of abolitionists ferrying people out of bondage, that's valuable information
to the enslaver. That's information that Douglass doesn't want that person to have. He himself doesn't give details about how he escaped in his autobiography. He wouldn't come clean
about how he did that until well after the end of the Civil War, when slavery was illegal everywhere, and he was out of danger. Knowing that Douglass was also wary about giving away too many
details of his own escape, because legally, in 1845, the family that enslaved him
could have just hired somebody to kidnap him back into slavery. Knowing that gives us the context to better understand his discomfort with what he calls the
upperground railroad, the open and advertised effort
to liberate enslaved people. He wants to maximize the
number of people freed, which means keeping the
Underground Railroad a secret. So, I hope the context I provided informed your understanding
of the passage. Remember, when reading
a historical text, ask, who was writing, what was
happening while they were writing, and why might they have said
or written what they did? Those details can help
grow your understanding, not just of historical texts,
but of contemporary ones too. Thanks for watching. You can learn anything.

Similarities and differences: different accounts of the same topic | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-JL39rcJlA,"- [David] Hello readers, I wanna talk about how two
texts about the same subject can approach that subject
in wildly different ways. Let's look at a story told across two different styles
of media, and as we do, pay attention to their similarities and their differences in presentation. First, let me tell you straightforwardly about a time I went to the grocery store. I needed eggs, so I biked to
the store along my usual route. I opted for an 18-er
instead of my usual dozen, but when I got home, I tripped
on the stairs to my apartment and I lost fully two thirds of the eggs. Oh, it was awful. I was
really crappy about it. I had to go out and get more eggs. Okay, so that's one take. Now, watch this. The following documentary
was based on real events. A simple trip to the grocery
store ends in tragedy. 18 went out, only six came back. ""18 Count"", coming to
WKHN, the 12th of never. (David coughs) I'd like to draw a quick Venn
diagram of these two events. What do they have in common? Right, so here are the things that the two depictions
have in common, right? They both contain a depiction of the event of the number of eggs that
I bought and then lost. So I bought 18. I lost 12, only six remained,
and let me label this. The one on the left is my
version, the original version, and the one on the right
is the movie version. Now, here are some things that
they don't have in common. My version has a straightforward tone, and the movie version has this
big overdramatic tone, right? My version describes irritation. The second version calls it a tragedy. My version has no music, and the movie version
has this intense music. The purpose of these two
accounts is different. One is to inform, there's
me telling you a story. The other is to entertain. Here's a trailer for a
movie coming to theaters. It can be illuminating to compare two versions of the same story, because certain aspects
of the story get magnified in each medium. Me telling you the story
amplifies how crabby I felt. Whereas if we pretend someone else was making the film
adaptation of ""18 Count"", they might choose to focus
on a different aspect, the drama and the tragedy of losing the eggs themselves, right? Probably there's lots of slow motion shots as each egg individually
bursts on the stairs, desperately sad violin music behind it. Anyway, the point is that next time you go see a movie version
of your favorite book or video game, or the next time you're
reading two different accounts to the same event or topic, think about what elements
are emphasized in each one. What does one medium do well
that another one does poorly? Food for thought. Well, no eggs for thought,

Similarities and differences: primary and secondary sources | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwjKRjIfxhE,"- [David] Hello, readers. Let's talk about primary
and secondary sources and how a firsthand account of
a historical event can differ from a contemporary
analysis of that same event. To do this and to further
explain what I mean, let us introduce our
setting for this video. The 1893 Chicago World's Fair, also known as the World's
Columbian Exposition. People from all over the
world set up exhibits in Chicago, corporations set up exhibits to showcase emerging technologies. This is the introduction
of the clothes zipper, the dishwasher, the chocolate brownie, the very foundations of modernity itself. But other countries also set up exhibits where they showcase their culture, their foods, their clothing. You'll see in a minute that
the primary source we found for this video references the
Egyptian section of the fair, where they made part of the fairgrounds into the Egyptian city of Cairo. And to review, or if you never knew, a primary source is a firsthand account, the source was present at
the event and witnessed it. A secondary source was not there, but heard about it or read about it. So let's look at our primary source. James Miller's 1893 letter to a newspaper in southeastern Ohio. ""I shall give you a few
notes taken from a list of wonderful things I saw at the Fair. We took a walk through
the streets of Cairo and witnessed an Egyptian wedding, which began with a wild dance
and ended with a sword fight. We also saw a woman take a
comfortable ride on a camel, and I have no doubt she saw more of Cairo than she could have seen afoot."" Now, 130 years later, we have this National
Park Service article, which relied on research
from four different sources. ""While showcasing global achievements and celebrating progress, the Exposition also reflected
the sexism of the time period. For example, the fair
had a Women's Building,"" there it is in the photo, ""Which exclusively featured
women's accomplishments. Yet, some women argued that displaying women's
achievements separately suggested that they were secondary to men. Women activists pushed for more
representation in the fair, but were excluded from decision-making."" I'm going to pause the video
here for a second for you to discuss what information
is repeated in both sources. What do you think the
authors would agree on, and what are the differences between them? What does the primary source
in yellow on the left, include that the secondary source in blue on the right, does not? And vice versa. Take your time. Pause the video in the
middle of this music. I'll be here when you get back. All right, and here we go. (upbeat music) Now, let's do a Venn diagram. Both texts are about the World's Fair, both mention exhibitions held there. The letter mentions the Egyptian exhibit. The article mentions the Women's Building. So the authors would probably
agree on some of the basics, like what the goal of the World's Fair was to showcase American and world cultures. But there are also a lot more
differences between the texts, though they would probably disagree on whether or not the World's
Fair achieved that goal of accurately showcasing American and world cultures to
their fullest extent. The modern article talks about some of the
behind-the-scenes wrangling about women's role in
decision-making for the Fair, which is information that Miller, the author of the 1893 letter, simply would not have had access to as a regular fairgoer from out of town. So we have differences in perspective. Miller is only one guy, whereas the secondary source can pull from lots of different sources, both primary and secondary sources, and bind them together to
give us a broader context. And we have differences in tone. The primary source is
essentially a postcard. Here's what I saw. Isn't it neat? And the secondary source has the distance to be more critical. Here's what was missing. Here's who wasn't invited. I think we tend to put a lot
of weight on primary sources, which is a legitimate thing to do. But primary source accounts
are often only the opinion of a single person. And they don't always cite sources. I keep a journal, but I don't
put a bibliography in it. And they're subject to biases. We all have them. Secondary sources do too. I could cherry-pick sources and make an argument that the World's Fair was
actually quite fair to women, even if the majority of other
scholars might disagree. This is why it's valuable to read widely, to compare texts that
disagree with one another, so you can fare it out, your understanding of the truth and the truth is rarely simple. What happened is rarely simple. History is not some
objective unchanging thing. History is a conversation
between the past and the present. It changes as our understandings change. It's a mirror that looks
different depending on where you stand, depending
on how the light hits it. So the best way to understand
that mirror, I believe, is to look at it from as many
angles as you possibly can. You can learn anything. David, out.",Firsthand vs. Secondary Accounts,The difference between firsthand (primary) accounts and secondhand (secondary) accounts.,00:00:00 - 00:02:00,2025-01-14T21:52:43Z,1081,20,1

Hannah. I am ready to teach. Hello. - [Hannah] You had to mow your lawn now? - [David] I know. I'm sorry. It's a whole thing. I have to do it in the morning because if I mow my lawn in the afternoon, all the neighborhood kids yell at me for interrupting their homework time. - [Hannah] I guess this is
actually a pretty good intro to our topic, connections, interactions
between ideas and people. Here's one event, you
mowing the lawn at 9:00 AM, and its cause, you getting
bullied by 13 year olds for mowing in the afternoon. - [David] All right. I mean,
I wouldn't say bullied. - [Hannah] Ideas, events
and people in a text are interconnected in a web of influence. Causes lead to effects. - [David] So we're gonna
talk to you today about how that comes into play in
an informational text. - [Hannah] To that end,
we have here an issue of a science magazine. - [David] Wow. Print media. - [Hannah] It's coming
back, I promise you. Let's turn to page 15. There's an article in there
about goat lawnmowers. Would you do me the honor
of reading this passage aloud, David? - [David] Sure. ""Renata Sandoval wants you to rent a goat for your backyard. Sandoval, the founder and
CEO of The Goat Brigade makes the case for goat mowers. 'Goats graze on overgrown
vegetation, including weeds and other unwanted plants. Compared to a lawnmower,
they're almost silent and they're much nicer to look at. Nobody ever says, ""Oh,
what a cute lawnmower!""' Sandoval also points out that goat mowers can
reduce safety risks related to wildfires. Goats munch on dry grass and plants, which lowers the amount of fuel available for fires to spread. Just last week, fire officials
reported that they were able to quickly contain a blaze
in nearby Baker County, thanks to recent grazing by
goats and sheep in the area."" - [Hannah] Thanks, David. Now that we've got our
text in front of us, let's make a couple of connections. I'll throw it to you readers. What does a goat's diet
have to do with wildfires? What connection is there
between what goats eat and the risk of fire? - [David] We'll put on
some music, have a snack, and give you some time to think. Pause the video if you need to, and when you're ready
we'll be here to discuss. - [Hannah] Let's hit it, David. (techno music) - [David] So what does a goat's diet have to do with wildfires, Hannah? - [Hannah] I was drawn
to this detail here. Goats eat plants, specifically,
they eat the sorts of vegetation that fuel
wildfires, dry grass and plants. So if you let goats graze, there'll be less dried grass lying around, and the effects of less dry grass is fewer and smaller wildfires. And we can see in the next
sentence how that idea to let goats and sheep
graze influenced an event. The event was a fire in Baker County that firefighters contained more easily because of goats grazing. - [David] And that's why Renata Sandoval, The Goat brigade lady, wants
me to rent one of her goats. - [Hannah] Yeah, so you
don't start a wildfire in your backyard. - [David] She wants her
business to succeed, but also she knows her goat's
interventions will reduce the risk of fire. - [Hannah] Exactly. The idea that goats can prevent fires influenced her decision to
start a rent a goat business. - [David] Man, that is a cool business. (keyboard clacking) - David?
- Yeah. One second. - [Hannah] David. - Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
- Are you Googling goat lawn care businesses? - Yeah, dude. Cute goats on the lawn
means the neighbor kids will stop yelling at me. I don't need that kind of smoke. - [Hannah] All right, readers. Remember, you can learn anything, except maybe how to enjoy mowing the lawn. - [David] David and Hannah out.",Goat Lawn Mowers and Wildfire Prevention,"Goat lawn mowers can reduce the risk of wildfires by grazing on dry grass and plants, thereby reducing the amount of fuel available for fires to spread.",00:00:00 - 00:07:00,2025-01-14T21:21:52Z,1155,20,1

text in front of us, let's make a couple of connections. I'll throw it to you readers. What does a goat's diet
have to do with wildfires? What connection is there
between what goats eat and the risk of fire? - [David] We'll put on
some music, have a snack, and give you some time to think. Pause the video if you need to, and when you're ready
we'll be here to discuss. - [Hannah] Let's hit it, David. (techno music) - [David] So what does a goat's diet have to do with wildfires, Hannah? - [Hannah] I was drawn
to this detail here. Goats eat plants, specifically,
they eat the sorts of vegetation that fuel
wildfires, dry grass and plants. So if you let goats graze, there'll be less dried grass lying around, and the effects of less dry grass is fewer and smaller wildfires. And we can see in the next
sentence how that idea to let goats and sheep
graze influenced an event. The event was a fire in Baker County that firefighters contained more easily because of goats grazing. - [David] And that's why Renata Sandoval, The Goat brigade lady, wants
me to rent one of her goats. - [Hannah] Yeah, so you
don't start a wildfire in your backyard. - [David] She wants her
business to succeed, but also she knows her goat's
interventions will reduce the risk of fire. - [Hannah] Exactly. The idea that goats can prevent fires influenced her decision to
start a rent a goat business. - [David] Man, that is a cool business. (keyboard clacking) - David?
- Yeah. One second. - [Hannah] David. - Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
- Are you Googling goat lawn care businesses? - Yeah, dude. Cute goats on the lawn
means the neighbor kids will stop yelling at me. I don't need that kind of smoke. - [Hannah] All right, readers.

stealing his snacks. We were supposed to be
talking about the relationship between ideas. - [David] Hey readers. I'm back. Ah, sorry for the delay,
Hannah. I am ready to teach. Hello. - [Hannah] You had to mow your lawn now? - [David] I know. I'm sorry. It's a whole thing. I have to do it in the morning because if I mow my lawn in the afternoon, all the neighborhood kids yell at me for interrupting their homework time. - [Hannah] I guess this is
actually a pretty good intro to our topic, connections, interactions
between ideas and people. Here's one event, you
mowing the lawn at 9:00 AM, and its cause, you getting
bullied by 13 year olds for mowing in the afternoon. - [David] All right. I mean,
I wouldn't say bullied. - [Hannah] Ideas, events
and people in a text are interconnected in a web of influence. Causes lead to effects. - [David] So we're gonna
talk to you today about how that comes into play in
an informational text. - [Hannah] To that end,
we have here an issue of a science magazine. - [David] Wow. Print media. - [Hannah] It's coming
back, I promise you. Let's turn to page 15. There's an article in there
about goat lawnmowers. Would you do me the honor
of reading this passage aloud, David? - [David] Sure. ""Renata Sandoval wants you to rent a goat for your backyard. Sandoval, the founder and
CEO of The Goat Brigade makes the case for goat mowers. 'Goats graze on overgrown
vegetation, including weeds and other unwanted plants. Compared to a lawnmower,
they're almost silent and they're much nicer to look at. Nobody ever says, ""Oh,
what a cute lawnmower!""' Sandoval also points out that goat mowers can
reduce safety risks related to wildfires. Goats munch on dry grass and plants, which lowers the amount of fuel available for fires to spread. Just last week, fire officials
reported that they were able to quickly contain a blaze
in nearby Baker County, thanks to recent grazing by
goats and sheep in the area."" - [Hannah] Thanks, David. Now that we've got our

Analyzing visual evidence (and vampires) | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjH-5npLi6s,"- [David] Raiders, hello. This video is about
analyzing visual evidence, but let's cut right to it. It's also about vampires. (spooky music)
(thunder booming) And we'll get to them, those cape wearing, widows peaked wonders of the mountains of Transylvania. But first, what do we even
mean by visual evidence? Like textual evidence, sure, we know what textual evidence is. It's written language. How do we know there's
potassium hydroxide in my soap? It's on the label. Ah, but how much potassium hydroxide? Visual evidence can tell us. Visual evidence includes the
graphs, charts, tables, images, and illustrations that
authors use in their texts. Authors include visual evidence to help readers better understand ideas because sometimes words just don't cut it. Visual evidence can help
strengthen a written argument and help express complicated ideas. So KOH, the potassium hydroxide, makes up 13.4% by weight of the soap. And sure it could list that
percentage on the label, but to my eye, seeing the number and the pie chart is more helpful. I can see at a glance that potassium hydroxide,
labeled here in red, only makes up a small part of my soap. This is useful because if
there were a lot more KOH than there already is, the soap would burn my
skin when I used it. Soap chemistry, visual evidence at work. Oftentimes, you will be asked
to evaluate visual evidence to see whether it supports or challenges an argument in a text. This is something you'll
have to do in many classes, history and science
classes as well as English. And questions about this
particular skill are common on standardized exams. So this brings us to vampires and specifically a very
complicated idea about vampires that some Norwegian researchers
wanted to test in 1994. Does garlic scare vampires away? This is a real study. They said something like,
according to folklore, garlic repels vampires. We wished to verify this, but owing to the lack of
vampires, we used leeches instead. Leeches, the real life
blood sucking worms. So like vampires, kinda. Based on the data, does garlic actually keep vampires away? Remembering that leches here
are our stand-ins for vampires. In a research setting,
the leches were presented with a hand smeared with garlic and a clean hand with the expectation that they would attach
themselves to one or the other. From our data, we conclude
that the relationship between vampires and garlic is blank. So here's the graph. What conclusions can you make about the traditional relationship between garlic and vampires? What does this graph say happens? What does the visual evidence tell you? I'm going to put a little music on. Feel free to pause the video and discuss or make your own guesses. Alright, see you in a bit. (soft music) So the title of this graph is: How Long Do Leeches Take to
Attach Themselves to a Hand? Right, and we have two bars
on the horizontal axis, the X axis. One is with garlic, the
other is without garlic. And over here on the Y
axis, the vertical axis, we can see that the legend reads seconds. That's how many seconds
the leches took to attach. This graph is potentially confusing because it might seem like the bigger bar is
the better one, right? But this is response time, how long do they take? So 14.9 seconds over here
versus 44.9 seconds over here. The shorter the response time, the faster the leach latches on. What can we conclude from
this study therefore, what was the main conclusion of the study? Well, basically the leeches went for the garlic covered hand,
the seasoned hand much faster, 30 seconds faster on
average than they went for the unseasoned hand. That means they like
the garlicky hand more than the ungarlicky hand. And remember, tradition holds that garlic repels vampires,
it sends them away. So from the result of this
study, we can conclude that their tradition is wrong
and vampires love garlic, if vampires and leeches are the same. Yeah, it's a bit of a leap. Maybe this particular case feels silly. Fine, but this is a useful skill. You will be asked to
evaluate visual evidence to see whether it supports or challenges an argument in a text. A friend will send you an infographic about a political topic. You might look up stats
for your favorite athlete. You might have to puzzle
through a misleading graph on TV news. Understanding what data is trying to tell us is a core reading skill. Information, now it's got
numbers in it, trademark. And now you've got numbers in you. Nice work. Watch out for leeches.

"Identifying ""hidden"" viewpoints | Reading | Khan Academy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_3u0e3XwCQ,"- [David] Hello readers. You ever see one of those videos where you think you're looking at a shoe and someone takes a knife to it and it's actually cake? That's what this video
is about, identifying when an author tries to
pass off one kind of text as another, cleverly
hiding their point of view, this shoe is actually cake, this informational text is
actually an argumentative one. This is a rather underhanded
sort of rhetoric, and when I say rhetoric, I mean the art of persuasive
speech or writing. Rhetoric includes a wide
range of tactics, right? From figurative language to appeals to the reader's emotions or logic, using heart-wrenching
imagery, invoking statistics. These are tools in the rhetorical toolkit and sometimes writers can use those tools to hide their viewpoint. Here, let me give you an example, which for the record does
not represent the views of either Khan Academy or me, and is provided for
training purposes only, here we go. The facts on American poverty. According to the US census, the poverty rate in
the year 2022 was 11.5% or 37.9 million people, but 89% of American households
have air conditioners, according to the US Energy
Information Administration and fully 99.4% have at least
one electric refrigerator. Both of these technologies
were luxuries a century ago. The American standard of living is high, even the percentage of households living in conditions deemed food insecure by the USDA was a mere 12.8% in 2022. In 2002, 20 years prior, the
USDA claimed that only 11.1% of American households were food insecure. It may be the case that impoverished is a term that does not accurately
describe these Americans. Whoof, okay, so that
excerpt is trying to argue by snowing us under
with context less facts that poverty doesn't really exist at the rate we think it does. I'm gonna go through and pick out some rhetorical techniques that will tell us that this
is an argumentative essay and not just an unbiased
informational one. Here we go. So the thing the author
of this passage wants to do is create doubt. Look at how they're doing that. We've got these quotation marks in the title around poverty, which is what they used to call scare quotes. Scare quotes are meant
to cast doubt on an idea. So already this shows that
the author wants you to think that poverty isn't real, right, so-called poverty. The passage also includes other words that are chosen to downplay poverty. The words mere and only a mere 12.8% of the population in 2022 is 12.8% of 333.3 million people, so like 42.6 million people, that doesn't sound mere to me, that's a ton of people. So the author is trying
to minimize something that many people agree
is horrible, millions of people going hungry. The passage uses a rhetorical appeal to the sense of logos, of reason, it's trying to satisfy
the desire for facts and figures using all these stats. Presenting this data gives the passage a feeling of accuracy and truthfulness, but do those numbers tell the full story? Sure, people might have refrigerators, but can they afford food to put in them? Here, the text gives the
reader a reason to say, ""We can all agree that
poverty is terrible, but what if there aren't as
many poor people as we fear?"" And operating from that
basis allows you to say, ""Well, maybe we're wasting
money on anti-poverty programs."" It is true that Americans have appliances, but is it accurate to say that simply because 89% of US households
have an air conditioner that those households
don't experience poverty? Is one thing a good measure of the other? I think the author of the
piece expects the reader to make the correlation
that if you have AC and a fridge, you can't
really be considered poor. But is that a common
way of measuring poverty or is someone's family income perhaps a more accurate way to measure that? Notice that income or
money is never mentioned. Why is that? It claims to be a fact sheet that's really presenting
an opinion on poverty. Once you know to look for this trick, you'll start seeing it everywhere, writers using rhetoric to
present their biased arguments as unbiased fact. So next time you're reading
an article, ask yourself, what are the techniques
that the authors use to try to convince their audience? What facts are the authors including and what facts are they not including? Are they truly providing
objective, unbiased information, or are they disguising their biases and opinions using rhetoric? Keep a sharp eye out readers, watch out for cake disguised as shoes.

USDA claimed that only 11.1% of American households were food insecure. It may be the case that impoverished is a term that does not accurately
describe these Americans. Whoof, okay, so that
excerpt is trying to argue by snowing us under
with context less facts that poverty doesn't really exist at the rate we think it does. I'm gonna go through and pick out some rhetorical techniques that will tell us that this
is an argumentative essay and not just an unbiased
informational one. Here we go. So the thing the author
of this passage wants to do is create doubt. Look at how they're doing that. We've got these quotation marks in the title around poverty, which is what they used to call scare quotes. Scare quotes are meant
to cast doubt on an idea. So already this shows that
the author wants you to think that poverty isn't real, right, so-called poverty. The passage also includes other words that are chosen to downplay poverty. The words mere and only a mere 12.8% of the population in 2022 is 12.8% of 333.3 million people, so like 42.6 million people, that doesn't sound mere to me, that's a ton of people. So the author is trying
to minimize something that many people agree
is horrible, millions of people going hungry. The passage uses a rhetorical appeal to the sense of logos, of reason, it's trying to satisfy
the desire for facts and figures using all these stats. Presenting this data gives the passage a feeling of accuracy and truthfulness, but do those numbers tell the full story? Sure, people might have refrigerators, but can they afford food to put in them? Here, the text gives the
reader a reason to say, ""We can all agree that
poverty is terrible, but what if there aren't as
many poor people as we fear?"" And operating from that
basis allows you to say, ""Well, maybe we're wasting
money on anti-poverty programs."" It is true that Americans have appliances, but is it accurate to say that simply because 89% of US households
have an air conditioner that those households
don't experience poverty? Is one thing a good measure of the other? I think the author of the
piece expects the reader to make the correlation
that if you have AC and a fridge, you can't
really be considered poor. But is that a common
way of measuring poverty or is someone's family income perhaps a more accurate way to measure that? Notice that income or
money is never mentioned. Why is that? It claims to be a fact sheet that's really presenting
an opinion on poverty. Once you know to look for this trick, you'll start seeing it everywhere, writers using rhetoric to
present their biased arguments as unbiased fact. So next time you're reading
an article, ask yourself, what are the techniques
that the authors use to try to convince their audience? What facts are the authors including and what facts are they not including? Are they truly providing
objective, unbiased information, or are they disguising their biases and opinions using rhetoric? Keep a sharp eye out readers, watch out for cake disguised as shoes.

How parts of an argument make a whole | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_11QgROQ9mY,"- [David] Hey readers, you've caught me just
as I was about to listen to my favorite podcast, ""Grumpy Li'l Guy"". Where the host finds something new to be unhappy about each episode. I probably shouldn't be
listening to podcasts at work, but this gives us a great opportunity to talk about how an author develops claims across a text,
how parts create a whole. You get to learn something and I get to chill out with
one of my favorite pods. Win-win. Our little secret. How about it? Okay, so I'm gonna put my feet up and put on the podcast. (bouncy music) ♪ He's a grumpy little guy. ♪ - [Host] Hey, this is Grumpy Li'l Guy with Dim Bin Rain Stone, brought to you by WKHN 90.3 FM and our partners at Khan Academy. Today, I want to talk to you
about loose shopping carts. Are they a sign of moral decline? - [David] Okay, hey, sorry, gonna get in real quick. I'm one of those people who loves to pause the podcast and discuss a lot. So, let's talk about how the host of this show is building his argument. Let's listen for a bit and then I'll divide up
the argument into sections. (David imitates skipping sound) - [Host] ...loose shopping carts. Are they a sign of moral decline? When I see a flock of
shopping carts uncared for and unloved clogging the parking lot of my local Save a Bunch, I feel a fury that borders on, ""Whoa, why don't we
care about one another?"" - [David] So our first section here introduces the main idea and gives some background
for the argument. The author is trying
to argue that a failure to put your shopping cart
back demonstrates a culture where people don't take
care of each other. Let's skip ahead. (David imitates skipping sound) - [Host] ... cart abandonment
as social contagion. The desire to put away your grocery cart is a socially considerate one, but studies indicate that
social disorder is infectious. A 2008 study in the Netherlands found that if you see graffiti in an alleyway, you'll feel more entitled to litter there. - [David] This section
is an expand and explain. The author expands on the main idea and explains more about it. Not just background or the context, but going deeper on the subject itself. So, we've got a reference
to a study that explains how and why cart abandonment might happen. Let's keep going. (David imitates skipping sound) - [Host] Who it hurts? Why is this bad you might be asking. What's the trouble here? Well, shopping carts don't have breaks. They can hit little kids, they
can block handicapped spaces, they can damage cars, they can
trundle outta the parking lot and into the road causing car crashes. - [David] This part of the
argument brings in examples to strengthen the original claim that not returning your grocery
cart is bad for society. The more specific the example the better. Vague assertions aren't compelling. If I say the weather was bad, that's less interesting than, ""Hail the size of a grapefruit punched a hole in my car's windshield."" Let's press on. (David imitates skipping sound) - [Host] Legitimate reasons
to abandon your cart. Now, I recognize that there are several legitimate
reasons why a person might not be able to return
a shopping cart easily. Perhaps you've got lots of children and can't wrangle the kids
and groceries by yourself. Perhaps you have a physical disability and can't return the cart on your own, but the fact that a minority of people cannot return carts
means that the rest of us as a society must support
you and fill in the gaps. - [David] Do you see how the podcaster is addressing a counter
argument and then absorbing it to make the overall
claim a little stronger? He acknowledges that some of
the reasons a person might have for not returning a cart are legitimate, but it strengthens the overall
argument to say that when one of us has a legitimate reason
they can't return the cart, the rest of us have to support them. So that's the structure of this argument. How a claim is developed across sections, with each section working
together to build support for and then strengthen the overall idea. First, introduce the
idea, give background. Second, expand and explain. Third, provide examples or data. And fourth, address counter arguments. This is a structure you can
use in your own arguments. And there are different structures
and orders to arguments. This obviously isn't the only one. Now, if you want to go back and read the whole argument, I'll put the full text
in the video description. Meanwhile, I think I've
hit the end of the episode. - [Host] Thanks so much

Choosing the best text evidence | Reading | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC24Qcpyn9E,"- [David] All right, readers, I wanna talk about choosing text evidence to support a claim. Readers have to do this all the time. You come across a question that asks you for the best text
evidence to prove a point. You've got a passage in front of you. Maybe it's a thousand words,
maybe it's a paragraph, but you have to support a claim using the best text
evidence you can muster. Let's get to our main
example for this video, which let me just warn you up top is a pretty spicy topic, okay? A real friendship ender. You ready? Deep breath. Here we go. Defining question of our time. Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable? It sounds silly, but this
fully went to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1893. Nix versus Hedden was the name
of the case. Some background. An 1883 law imposed
heavy taxes on vegetables imported from other
countries, but not fruit. Now, scientifically speaking,
tomatoes are fruits. They grow out of a flower and they've got seeds on the inside. This is the argument that
John Nix brought to the court. If a tomato is a fruit, you
can't tax it as a vegetable. Now in his decision, Supreme Court Justice Horace Gray wrote, ""Botanically speaking, tomatoes
are the fruit of a vine just as are cucumbers
squashes, beans and peas. But in the common language of
the people, whether sellers or consumers of provisions, all these are vegetables which
are grown in kitchen gardens and which whether eaten cooked or raw, are like potatoes,
carrots, parsnips, turnips, beets, cauliflower, cabbage,
celery, and lettuce, usually served at dinner in
with or after the soup, fish or meats, which constitute the
principle part of the repast and not, like fruits
generally, as dessert."" And what's a repast? It's an
old fashioned word for meal. So the principle part of a
repast is the main course of a meal. Which evidence from
this text best supports the court's claim that
tomatoes are vegetables? And we'll just make it easy,
pare it down to three choices. Which of these three
best supports that claim that tomatoes equal vegetables? Pause the video here and discuss. 3, 2, 1. (bright music) Okay, and we're back. Let's break down some of the evidence that Justice Gray uses. In this first one here, ""Tomatoes are the fruit of a
vine, just as are cucumbers, squashes, beans and peas."" That sounds like it's
acknowledging the counterargument. That's saying, ""Okay, technically tomatoes are botanically fruit."" So while that may strengthen
the overall argument, because then you can swerve back around and say ""That's true, but, there's this even stronger evidence."" This evidence does not support the claim that tomatoes are vegetables. In fact, it says the opposite.
So let's cross that out. Second one, ""In the common
language of the people, these are vegetables."" That's kind of a ""Because
I said so"" argument. What's the data that undergirds that? Which people? How many people? And does the fact that people believe a thing make it true? People saying these plants are vegetables, doesn't really prove that
they're vegetables, right? Nevertheless, this is stronger
than ""Tomatoes are fruit."" I'd call this relevant evidence. It does provide some
support for the claim, but is it the best evidence? Let's look at the last piece. ""Whether eaten cooked or raw, vegetables are usually served at dinner, and not like fruits
generally, as dessert."" So this last one is all about
that big list of vegetables, including tomatoes that
are served for dinner and not for dessert like a fruit would be. This is a cultural
definition of a vegetable, a question of how the food item is used, which is even stronger than
what the food item is called. I think this is our best evidence. People use tomatoes like
vegetables when they eat them, so they're vegetables. Good job. Option three. You are the best. In your own writing, when you need to find supporting evidence for an argument that you're making, look for those strong examples that are directly linked

vegetables when they eat them, so they're vegetables. Good job. Option three. You are the best. In your own writing, when you need to find supporting evidence for an argument that you're making, look for those strong examples that are directly linked
to the claim you're making. Keep it as brief and as direct as you can. Claim. My sister picked up a
package for me when I was out. Evidence. My doorbell camera
captured her doing that. I have every confidence
that you'll be able to find the best text
evidence for your claims. And my evidence for that
is you taking the time to learn With me today. You can learn anything.

Rhode Island and Khan Academy Info Session,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7McrG9taZak,"- Recording. All right, good morning, good morning. Welcome to our Khan Academy Khanmigo Rhode Island Partnership webinar. Before we get started, this
is a very important question. How are you feeling on
a scale of my dog, Luna? Whatever you say is correct. Just put some numbers in there. I'm feeling five to be here,
but nine for this week. Three is the winner, I know. She was such a grumpy unicorn. She's so hilarious that I had
to make a mood meter of her 'cause this is literally
like I've never seen a dog more expressive than my dog. All right, we got some nines, some tens. All right, all right, great.
- What is she doing in five? Is that a bath? Is that like a pool? - It's a kitty litter box, and it was a hundred degrees in Florida, so we filled it with water. And she was so happy to get in there and just, yep, she took a bath. (laughs) This number four was her during COVID. Eight, somebody put
birthday stuff on her lawn and she didn't know what
that was, so she was like, ""What is this?"" So, that picture just cracks me up. All right, well, good morning everyone. We are so excited to have you on this call to learn about our partnership. My name is Danielle Sullivan. I am the northeast manager
of district partnerships for Khan Academy. I am just part of your
amazing Rhode Island team. I'm joined today by Brian
Carter. I'll let him say hello. - Hey, everybody. Brian Carter. I'm based in Atlanta. I lead the strategic partnership work and we're really excited
to talk to you today about this new partnership with College Board, RIDE, and you all. - And then, you also
have two other members of the Khan Academy team that
you'll be definitely meeting and engaging with. Dr. Sarah Thaler, she's gonna be your district success manager. She actually used to
work for College Board. And then, Diona Clingman is your amazing professional
development specialist. So we make up your Khan
Academy Rhode Island team, but none of this could have been possible without the amazing support of RIDE. So, I want just Mike to say
hello and talk about his team. - Hi. Good morning, everyone. Greetings from the
Nursing Education Center Downtown, Providence here. And I'm happy to be joining you and joining this project with you. On our screen are the people from RIDE that make up the team that can assist you. One is Lisa Odom-Villella. She's the deputy commissioner
for Instructional Programs. Then Steve Osborn, who's our
state state strategy officer and student opportunities. I'm the director of the Office of College
and Career Readiness. And Melissa Kusinitz is our ED specialist. So, Melissa and I are
the leads on the project. So, we are here for every
step of the way for you and if you need anything,
you know where we are and please let us know and contact us. - Thank you so much, Mike. So, we are so excited to let
you know that it's official. There is a partnership
between Khan Academy, RIDE, and College Board. And what that means is you get the Khan
Academy Districts Program, plus Khanmigo for students,
free for the next 18 months. It is normally $15 per student, but with through this partnership,
you are getting it free. Yes, free is the optimal word. So today, we're gonna show you
a little bit about the tools you're gonna be using and
talk about the partnership. But if you are like,
""Yes, how do I sign up?"" You can go ahead and take
a picture of this QR code, but Brian put the link in the chat. This is going to bring
you to our landing page for Rhode Island, where
you can select to sign up through a Contract Request Form, which is going to look like this. You just have to fill in some
information of your district. And yes, there is some billing. We asked for the billing and
the superintendent's name, but that you're not getting charged. We're asking that just for
our contracting purposes. So if you are a yes, please
go ahead and fill this out. We really wanna sign up
partners before January 15th, so you can take advantage of all the tools I'm about to show you for the second half of this school year, and
then all of next school year. And the process will be,
once you fill out that form, it's gonna take a couple of days. We'll get the contract out to you. You've returned the contract to us. We will immediately start
you in the rostering process. You'll just let us know which day you wanna activate your accounts, and then you get to learning. So, the process is pretty seamless. And we do have a Data Privacy Agreement that has been approved by RIDE. The instructions are here. I'll go over those in a second. But you can also see the instructions on the the Contract Request Form, as well as that landing page. Basically, you need an SDPC account. You're gonna log in and
see the Khan Academy for district's DPA in
the resource registry. Our DPA's available through the SDPC Auto Exhibit E Creator. And if you get confused at all, it is part of the tech consortium. So, that's where you have to log in. But again, these instructions are on the Contract Request Form. This video will be on,
once we finish today, we'll have a recording of
this on our landing page, and then all of the slides will
be on the landing page too. So again, sign up before January 15th. Questions about any of that, you can put 'em in the chat. But then, I'm gonna spend the rest of our 25 minutes together talking about the tools
and resources you will get as part of this Khan Academy, RIDE, College Board partnership. We're gonna go over why
learning's important and how AI can help, how
we're saving teachers time, what are the goals for
success for the SAT pieces. And then again, I'm
gonna go over the details of the partnership. Great. ""If districts already completed this, then teachers do,"" correct, Jennifer. Yep. If your teachers wanna watch
the video, that's fine, but we have a lot of PL that will roll out once we
have districts signed up. So first, I wanna just talk through who are we at Khan Academy, right? So Khan Academy is a nonprofit, and our mission is to provide
a free world class education to anyone anywhere. It started with Sal Khan,
our founder and CEO, tutoring his family. And our mission is to
have anyone on the planet have a Khan Academy account for free. But then, we started really
wanting to work with districts. And I wanna show you that at Khan Academy, we're a little bit different because student learning is our Northstar. We always, all of our
metrics and our mission is to really ensure that students can achieve grade level
success and beyond. And we do that through mastery learning, which is now enhanced by our AI tools. So like I said, it started with Sal Khan just putting, you know, videos on YouTube. Then the platform came out in 2010. But then in 2018, we started
our district program, which is what you were
going to get for free, which includes the AI that has service, automatic rostering, data
dashboard, and then some. That's really the only
way to get the student facing Socratic tutors. So, that is what you will get
as part of the partnership. And it's really important
to us that you know that we wanna make sure that
you are using these tools in a safe, responsible manner. So we value privacy, security, compliance. And as I go live and show
you some of the tools, you'll be able to see those
guardrails that we put in. But I would love for you to take a minute and listen to our founder, Sal Khan, welcome you to this partnership. You might need to turn up your
computer just a little bit. He's a little quiet. - Hi, Rhode Island district leaders. Sal here from Khan Academy. And I just wanted to let you know about a very exciting partnership that I think you will be interested in. And it is a three-way
partnership between Khan Academy, the College Board, the creators of the SAT and other assessments, and your state and the
state of Rhode Island. And this is the only partnership
like this on the planet. And the goal of it is to help ensure that your students are
optimally college ready as evidenced by the SAT. So, this partnership is
an 18-month partnership where every district in
the state of Rhode Island, and there's no other partnership
like this in the country or the planet, will get free access to the Khan Academy District offering, which provides things like
professional development and support district dashboards, so you can keep track of things. And it's especially relevant, it can be used across your
district in multiple grades. And this is for nine through 12. So this is for high school, but in multiple grades of high
school and multiple subjects. But the focus of it is the
official SAT preparation that we've been working on for
years with the College Board to help your students
be optimally prepared. And as part of that, they
are also going to have access to state-of-the-art AI tools, Khanmigo. And once again, I will
emphasize there's no catch here. All of this is free. And we hope to really partner with as many of you as possible because our mission is, I
think, the same as your mission. How do we empower as many folks? How do we provide a world class education for anyone, anywhere? How do we make sure that
everyone is college-ready and has the maximum
opportunities available to them? So, very excited to go on
this journey with all of you. - Thank you, Sal. We are super excited to go on
the journey with you as well. So, let's dig into what
you are going to get as part of the partnership. First, I wanna talk about learning and AI. So, another quick assessment. How are you feeling about AI in general on a scale of hose in the face, Terminator like or GEICO pig excited? And whatever you say is correct. You can hold up a number if you're like... Okay, we got some
excited, some pig excited. That's exciting. I feel we got some threes, some twos. Sometimes, I'm in the middle, like I'm excited about our tools, but sometimes when I see
new AI tools, I'm like, ""What's it gonna look like?"" Great, so we're a little
all over the board. Perfect. Well hopefully after you
start to use Khanmigo, you're gonna feel a little
bit more GEICO pig excited. So, I wanna talk about
learning for a minute the act of learning. I'm not talking about teaching. Just think about students in classrooms. Learning is messy, loud, unpredictable, and extraordinarily vulnerable. We are asking kids to show
up, admit they don't know, make mistakes all in front of their peers. And we know based on research that students will learn more
when they're actively engaged in the material. When they're it's right at
the edge of struggle, right? It can't be too easy, too hard. When they get immediate feedback. And they also need to see the
value of what they're learning and have it applied to
what they're interested in. Oftentimes, I've gone through schools and seen all these great posters about learning and growth mindset, but then classrooms look like this. Or more importantly, or actually more challengingly, that's a new word for
a Friday, made it up. You'll have many students in a classroom and it's really hard for teachers to be able to do that personalized
instruction all the time, which is why we have developed Khanmigo as a true Socratic tutor. The problems we are trying
to solve with Khanmigo, giving students the immediate
feedback, personalization, differentiation of learning in
the moment when they need it. And it's not gonna give students answers. And it's really designed to support and enhance student thinking and learning. So, how does Khanmigo work? Well, Khanmigo actually wears three hats. We have Khanmigo that works alongside our Khan Academy content, which is a huge push for this
partnership is the SAT course. But you can also use any of our courses. You will have automatic rostering for all of your high school students, and then your teachers have access to a wide variety of courses that you can use to
supplement your curriculum. We will focus primarily on
the SAT course this morning, but know you have lots and lots of options to enhance with Khan Academy content. But Khanmigo works alongside
our Khan Academy content. There are learning activities, and then there are teacher activities. So, let me show you what it looks like when
students are taking anything in the digital SAT. So if I am taking an activity around the Foundations of Algebra and I am doing a problem on understanding the systems of linear equations and foundations, and I'm stuck. I don't know what to answer. I don't just wanna guess. This is where Khanmigo comes in. Lives right here on the right
hand side of your screen. I'm gonna make this a little bit bigger. So the first off, I'm just point
out a couple of guardrails. We do not want students to
share personal information. We don't collect it. We don't want them to share it. Secondly, the chat is logged, but it's logged for you to mine as data. We'll log it for one academic year, but we're not sharing
this back out with OpenAI. We have text to speech, speech to text, and then Khanmigo speaks English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hindu fluently. But it can translate in
other languages as well. So, the first thing
that kids might ask is, ""Why do I even care about understanding solving systems of linear equations?"" There are prompts for students
if they want them turned on, but again, you saw that
little calculating math. We built another layer of AI to help minimize math
mistakes in particular. So Khanmigo says, ""Understanding
systems of linear equations are important because it helps
solve real world problems. Check out this video to
see why it's important."" So students could say, ""Gimme an example,"" ""What are the steps,""
""I don't understand,"" or ""Give me the answer,"" which is what a lot of kids will do next. It's great. I just tell me what to do. This is not, Khanmigo is
not going to give students the answer. It is going to help them understand what they think the answer is. So, it can be differentiate in the moment. It can make things a little
bit easier for students. It can make things harder or even relate this to football for me. And look, spelling does not matter. Khanmigo can also speak text, like IDK and all of the things. So now, what it's doing, because I told Khanmigo that
I'm interested in football, it's gonna start relating
this to football. Like think of an equation as a
strategy for a football game. I can even have it
relate to more football. So if I'm somebody who loves football and can understand that,
but struggling with math, this is what we were talking about and making it relevant
and engaging for students. So, this is one way you can use Khanmigo alongside Khan Academy content. But we also have many
other learner activities using Khanmigo for students. The first section is the Tutor Me section. So, this is an opportunity
to have that Socratic tutor with other content beyond Khan Academy. So, and teachers are actually
can assign this content to students. So, I was working with a
science teacher in New York who was assigning Tutor Me Science to have students research lunar cycles before she was teaching that. So, that's just one aspect
of how you can utilize this. And students can open this up and use this with any type
of work that they're doing. We also have practicing knowledge. So, students can actually get
quizzed on certain topics. They can practice for AP exams. They can debate Khanmigo on a variety of topics for high school. They can chat with literary characters and historical figures. So, I was actually working
with a high school teacher who's about to teach ""Macbeth."" So, she was having her
students chat with Macbeth to learn more or even
after they read something, like if after you read
""Pride and Prejudice,"" you can have come in
and talk to Mr. Darcy. I have a lot of, there's a lot of social
studies and science teachers who are utilizing Chatting
with historical figures. I had a social or a science
teacher assign students to talk to Albert Einstein
about thermodynamics. So, it's really interesting
and creative the way that you can utilize these tools. There are additional
vocabulary activities, options for students to explore
college and career ready or just future career growth. But I wanna point out Writing coach because this I don't know if you saw, but we were on ""60 Minutes,"" on Sunday. I'm surprised how many people
still watch ""60 Minutes,"" to be quite honest. But I think it's kind
of in between football, so people just were really excited. But then, we did have a
great piece with Rhode Island about the partnership. Brian just put that link in the chat. So, we did feature Writing coach. So what Writing coach is it's available 7th through 12th grade. Any of your teachers
can use writing coach. I'm talking a music teacher,
science teacher, ELA teacher. But this was designed
by our product manager, who was a former ELA teacher. And also did you know that
students in high school should be writing for 60 minutes a day? Are your students writing
for 60 minutes a day? Yeah, I'm just, everyone's like, ""Hmm, no, Danielle, they are not."" So the way this works, we designed this as a
true instructional tool. You can assign the essay. So you can, you put the
assignment title, the grade level, what type of essay,
any type of information that you wanna put in there. And then when students have it, they will have a list of essays. And this is what their
experience looks like. First of all, Khanmigo is here to help them understand the prompt, like explain the essay type,
what are their requirements, help me understand what
I'm supposed to do here. Then, the students actually
outline right in Khanmigo in Writing coach. And then, they have
Khanmigo here to help them if they wanna check the
outline, they're stuck. They're struggling with a thesis. They're struggling with
any of the information. But Khanmigo is not going
to give them a thesis. Right here, like gimme a thesis. ""I can't provide a thesis for you, but I can help you refine your ideas."" Then students go into drafting mode. And another guardrail
we have is if students are typing into Khanmigo, and then go home and cut and paste their entire essay from ChatGPT-4, it will flag it for teachers. And the final piece is the revision piece. So, this is going to give
some suggestions on revision, but it's not gonna grade
it for the teachers. But the teachers can use our rubric tools to create rubrics to
help grade the essays. So, this is all available to your students through Khanmigo, the
student facing tutor, both alongside Khan Academy content, and then all of these learner activities. Questions about that before
we go on to the teacher piece? I know this is fast and furious y'all, but okay, we have 10 minutes left. Okay, gotta speed it up even more. So the next piece, I know it's December. If you are a teacher, you
might be feeling like this. If you are a leader, you're
probably feeling like this. So, what we designed are a bunch of tools to help save you time. So, our teacher tools live right here. And then, most of these were free, are free for any teacher in US, but part of the partnership, you get an extra added ChatGPT for Omni. You also have the ability
to summarize the students, understand what students are
talking to Khanmigo about using AI. And then, you also have access to what's called companion mode. So, those are all part
of the paid partnership. And these tools, again, we're
gonna give you lots of time and lots of opportunities
to learn about these, but that they're tools
to like exit tickets, and discussion prompts, and lesson plans, ways to differentiate,
ways to support students. But I wanna show you the
class snapshot real quick, because when students are
working through the digital SAT, or if you're using any
Khan Academy content every, this data will update every seven days. So, what you can do is say, Khanmigo, what are the students
doing in digital SAT? It'll tell you how many
minutes, how many assignments, how many skills, but the
magic is the next steps. Because a lot of times for high school, you know that you wanna do
small group instruction, but sometimes, you don't have time, or you don't have the data, or you don't have the right resources. So this, I'm asking Khanmigo to group my students based on this data. Not only can I assign
this back to the students, but here's where you can
use the teacher AI tools. So now I'm like, ""This is great, but I wanna do something fun in class around this numbers of
solution to equation challenge, knowing that half the kids in my class need to work on this."" So now, I'm like, ""Give me student centered
station rotations dealing with winter or football,"" or any type of, anything
that you can think of that would engage the students. So now, I'm using the teacher tools to have really fun hot
cocoa equation stations, winter world problem stations. So now, we have some station rotations for students based on this content. We also have the teacher tools embedded throughout Khan Academy. So if you wanted to create
an Exit Ticket, Lesson Hook, we're trying to make
things a lot easier for you at point of use. Questions about that very fast. All right, last two pieces. How are we setting you up
to support you with the SAT? Because that is the big
push for this partnership. We are going to give
you lots of information, lots of guidance, and lots of support, including what's the best way to implement this from the SAT prep class, summer school programs, data trackers. We also will advise you through different
implementation strategies like how are we going
to really maximize time for students to have these tools? How can you also supplement your core ELA and math instruction with these tools? And then, the role of the teacher from good, better, and best. Like what's the best way to do this? What should you be doing? What should your students be doing? And then, we give you
resources for students. Because Khanmigo is built on OpenAI, the more specific you
can be with Khanmigo, the better the feedback will be. That is both the teacher
tools and the student tools. So, we have support around all of that. And then especially
supporting with small groups, because high school is the
new middle school after COVID. I'm sure y'all have felt that. So, we wanna give you options on to maximize learning
environments with students. So, all of this is rolled
into our district partnership. So again, you are supported with our team. Sarah Thaler is your
district success manager. She used to work at College Board. She's amazing. Diona Clingman is your professional
development specialist. Also amazing. Ton of background and supports. Both were former educators, current educators, the whole thing. And you also have Brian and
I to round out the team. And then, the partnership could not be complete without RIDE. Like Mike said, this is the team that's gonna support you
on the Rhode Island side. And as part of the
partnership, you get access to all of our Khan Academy content. You have a district dashboard
that's going to give you data around Khan Academy content,
as well as Khanmigo. You have Khanmigo teacher tools and then the student Socratic tutor, the implementation guidance. And we have specific
Rhode Island guidance. So, once you sign up with us and we start getting you rostered, you'll also have access to our professional learning pacing guide, what to expect as part of the
partnership, goal setting. The professional learning is
going to be all year round. We're starting with some
amazing recording courses tailored for SAT from Diona, including SAT Prep Part 1 and
2, how to monitor progress, and then actually how to
prepare for the assessment. All of this is wrapped into a program that has safety security guardrails, moderating tools, et cetera, and the specific RIDE approved
data privacy agreement. You just need to have Clever or ClassLink for rostering, Clever or ClassLink. If for some reason you
don't have one or the other, Clever is free. So, we can help you make sure
you set up a Clever account. But I think most of the
schools have Clever actually. Clever, ClassLink. And again, here are the steps. You're gonna fill out that form. First off, if you're a
yes, fill out the form. If you still need to meet with me, feel free to meet with me. You can book time with me from the... Brian, there's a great
question if you in the chat while I'm still, I'm just finished this because we only have five minutes left. I'll come back to you Nita, okay. So first, you're gonna
request the contract, then it's gonna take a couple days. So, we have to go through a
little process on our end. Then once you return the contract to us, we will get you rostering. Then, you'll decide when
you want it activated and we'll get you to the learning. So, how do you do all of this? You sign up before January 15th, y'all. You can go to this QR code. Brian put the link in the chat. And then this is again, this
will be our one stop shop for everything Rhode Island. So this blog, please bookmark it because this will be,
excuse me, I'm so excited. Lemme just take a drink of water. We will have the video of
this learning series here. We'll have the slide deck
that I've been using. But everything you need
to know is on this blog. And again, this is what
the Contract Request Form looks like. And we really want you to
sign up before January 15th. I think I said 17th and 15th
on two different slides. So, you get it. Before mid-January is when
we want you to sign up. And in conclusion, as a nonprofit, our goal is to support
you and your students to drive deep student learning. We appreciate you. We're so
excited for you to join us. And here is my contact information if you have any questions
or further anything. So, I'm gonna stop the recording. Yes, we'll share the slides
on that website too, Vanessa. Okay, stop the, I'm
gonna stop the recording, answer some of these
questions, so gimme a second. Great.",Khan Academy Partnership,"The webinar announces the official partnership between Khan Academy, Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE), and College Board.",00:00:00 - 00:04:00,2024-12-17T19:16:33Z,8871,99,11
Rhode Island and Khan Academy Info Session,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7McrG9taZak,"- Recording. All right, good morning, good morning. Welcome to our Khan Academy Khanmigo Rhode Island Partnership webinar. Before we get started, this
is a very important question. How are you feeling on
a scale of my dog, Luna? Whatever you say is correct. Just put some numbers in there. I'm feeling five to be here,
but nine for this week. Three is the winner, I know. She was such a grumpy unicorn. She's so hilarious that I had
to make a mood meter of her 'cause this is literally
like I've never seen a dog more expressive than my dog. All right, we got some nines, some tens. All right, all right, great.
- What is she doing in five? Is that a bath? Is that like a pool? - It's a kitty litter box, and it was a hundred degrees in Florida, so we filled it with water. And she was so happy to get in there and just, yep, she took a bath. (laughs) This number four was her during COVID. Eight, somebody put
birthday stuff on her lawn and she didn't know what
that was, so she was like, ""What is this?"" So, that picture just cracks me up. All right, well, good morning everyone. We are so excited to have you on this call to learn about our partnership. My name is Danielle Sullivan. I am the northeast manager

and resources you will get as part of this Khan Academy, RIDE, College Board partnership. We're gonna go over why
learning's important and how AI can help, how
we're saving teachers time, what are the goals for
success for the SAT pieces. And then again, I'm
gonna go over the details of the partnership. Great. ""If districts already completed this, then teachers do,"" correct, Jennifer. Yep. If your teachers wanna watch
the video, that's fine, but we have a lot of PL that will roll out once we
have districts signed up. So first, I wanna just talk through who are we at Khan Academy, right? So Khan Academy is a nonprofit, and our mission is to provide
a free world class education to anyone anywhere. It started with Sal Khan,
our founder and CEO, tutoring his family. And our mission is to
have anyone on the planet have a Khan Academy account for free. But then, we started really
wanting to work with districts. And I wanna show you that at Khan Academy, we're a little bit different because student learning is our Northstar. We always, all of our
metrics and our mission is to really ensure that students can achieve grade level
success and beyond. And we do that through mastery learning, which is now enhanced by our AI tools. So like I said, it started with Sal Khan just putting, you know, videos on YouTube. Then the platform came out in 2010. But then in 2018, we started
our district program, which is what you were
going to get for free, which includes the AI that has service, automatic rostering, data
dashboard, and then some. That's really the only
way to get the student facing Socratic tutors. So, that is what you will get
as part of the partnership. And it's really important
to us that you know that we wanna make sure that
you are using these tools in a safe, responsible manner. So we value privacy, security, compliance. And as I go live and show
you some of the tools, you'll be able to see those
guardrails that we put in. But I would love for you to take a minute and listen to our founder, Sal Khan, welcome you to this partnership. You might need to turn up your
computer just a little bit. He's a little quiet. - Hi, Rhode Island district leaders. Sal here from Khan Academy. And I just wanted to let you know about a very exciting partnership that I think you will be interested in. And it is a three-way
partnership between Khan Academy, the College Board, the creators of the SAT and other assessments, and your state and the
state of Rhode Island. And this is the only partnership
like this on the planet. And the goal of it is to help ensure that your students are
optimally college ready as evidenced by the SAT. So, this partnership is
an 18-month partnership where every district in
the state of Rhode Island, and there's no other partnership
like this in the country or the planet, will get free access to the Khan Academy District offering, which provides things like
professional development and support district dashboards, so you can keep track of things. And it's especially relevant, it can be used across your
district in multiple grades. And this is for nine through 12. So this is for high school, but in multiple grades of high
school and multiple subjects. But the focus of it is the
official SAT preparation that we've been working on for
years with the College Board to help your students
be optimally prepared. And as part of that, they
are also going to have access to state-of-the-art AI tools, Khanmigo. And once again, I will
emphasize there's no catch here. All of this is free. And we hope to really partner with as many of you as possible because our mission is, I
think, the same as your mission. How do we empower as many folks? How do we provide a world class education for anyone, anywhere? How do we make sure that
everyone is college-ready and has the maximum
opportunities available to them? So, very excited to go on
this journey with all of you. - Thank you, Sal. We are super excited to go on
the journey with you as well. So, let's dig into what
you are going to get as part of the partnership. First, I wanna talk about learning and AI. So, another quick assessment. How are you feeling about AI in general on a scale of hose in the face, Terminator like or GEICO pig excited? And whatever you say is correct. You can hold up a number if you're like... Okay, we got some
excited, some pig excited. That's exciting. I feel we got some threes, some twos. Sometimes, I'm in the middle, like I'm excited about our tools, but sometimes when I see
new AI tools, I'm like, ""What's it gonna look like?"" Great, so we're a little
all over the board. Perfect. Well hopefully after you
start to use Khanmigo, you're gonna feel a little
bit more GEICO pig excited. So, I wanna talk about
learning for a minute the act of learning. I'm not talking about teaching. Just think about students in classrooms. Learning is messy, loud, unpredictable, and extraordinarily vulnerable. We are asking kids to show
up, admit they don't know, make mistakes all in front of their peers. And we know based on research that students will learn more
when they're actively engaged in the material. When they're it's right at
the edge of struggle, right? It can't be too easy, too hard. When they get immediate feedback. And they also need to see the
value of what they're learning and have it applied to
what they're interested in. Oftentimes, I've gone through schools and seen all these great posters about learning and growth mindset, but then classrooms look like this. Or more importantly, or actually more challengingly, that's a new word for
a Friday, made it up. You'll have many students in a classroom and it's really hard for teachers to be able to do that personalized
instruction all the time, which is why we have developed Khanmigo as a true Socratic tutor. The problems we are trying
to solve with Khanmigo, giving students the immediate
feedback, personalization, differentiation of learning in
the moment when they need it. And it's not gonna give students answers. And it's really designed to support and enhance student thinking and learning. So, how does Khanmigo work? Well, Khanmigo actually wears three hats. We have Khanmigo that works alongside our Khan Academy content, which is a huge push for this
partnership is the SAT course. But you can also use any of our courses. You will have automatic rostering for all of your high school students, and then your teachers have access to a wide variety of courses that you can use to
supplement your curriculum. We will focus primarily on
the SAT course this morning, but know you have lots and lots of options to enhance with Khan Academy content. But Khanmigo works alongside
our Khan Academy content. There are learning activities, and then there are teacher activities. So, let me show you what it looks like when
students are taking anything in the digital SAT. So if I am taking an activity around the Foundations of Algebra and I am doing a problem on understanding the systems of linear equations and foundations, and I'm stuck. I don't know what to answer. I don't just wanna guess. This is where Khanmigo comes in. Lives right here on the right
hand side of your screen. I'm gonna make this a little bit bigger. So the first off, I'm just point
out a couple of guardrails. We do not want students to
share personal information. We don't collect it. We don't want them to share it. Secondly, the chat is logged, but it's logged for you to mine as data. We'll log it for one academic year, but we're not sharing
this back out with OpenAI. We have text to speech, speech to text, and then Khanmigo speaks English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hindu fluently. But it can translate in
other languages as well. So, the first thing
that kids might ask is, ""Why do I even care about understanding solving systems of linear equations?"" There are prompts for students
if they want them turned on, but again, you saw that
little calculating math. We built another layer of AI to help minimize math
mistakes in particular. So Khanmigo says, ""Understanding
systems of linear equations are important because it helps
solve real world problems. Check out this video to
see why it's important."" So students could say, ""Gimme an example,"" ""What are the steps,""
""I don't understand,"" or ""Give me the answer,"" which is what a lot of kids will do next. It's great. I just tell me what to do. This is not, Khanmigo is
not going to give students the answer. It is going to help them understand what they think the answer is. So, it can be differentiate in the moment. It can make things a little
bit easier for students. It can make things harder or even relate this to football for me. And look, spelling does not matter. Khanmigo can also speak text, like IDK and all of the things. So now, what it's doing, because I told Khanmigo that
I'm interested in football, it's gonna start relating
this to football. Like think of an equation as a
strategy for a football game. I can even have it
relate to more football. So if I'm somebody who loves football and can understand that,
but struggling with math, this is what we were talking about and making it relevant
and engaging for students. So, this is one way you can use Khanmigo alongside Khan Academy content. But we also have many
other learner activities using Khanmigo for students. The first section is the Tutor Me section. So, this is an opportunity
to have that Socratic tutor with other content beyond Khan Academy. So, and teachers are actually
can assign this content to students. So, I was working with a
science teacher in New York who was assigning Tutor Me Science to have students research lunar cycles before she was teaching that. So, that's just one aspect
of how you can utilize this. And students can open this up and use this with any type
of work that they're doing. We also have practicing knowledge. So, students can actually get
quizzed on certain topics. They can practice for AP exams. They can debate Khanmigo on a variety of topics for high school. They can chat with literary characters and historical figures. So, I was actually working
with a high school teacher who's about to teach ""Macbeth."" So, she was having her
students chat with Macbeth to learn more or even
after they read something, like if after you read
""Pride and Prejudice,"" you can have come in
and talk to Mr. Darcy. I have a lot of, there's a lot of social
studies and science teachers who are utilizing Chatting
with historical figures. I had a social or a science
teacher assign students to talk to Albert Einstein
about thermodynamics. So, it's really interesting
and creative the way that you can utilize these tools. There are additional
vocabulary activities, options for students to explore
college and career ready or just future career growth. But I wanna point out Writing coach because this I don't know if you saw, but we were on ""60 Minutes,"" on Sunday. I'm surprised how many people
still watch ""60 Minutes,"" to be quite honest. But I think it's kind
of in between football, so people just were really excited. But then, we did have a
great piece with Rhode Island about the partnership. Brian just put that link in the chat. So, we did feature Writing coach. So what Writing coach is it's available 7th through 12th grade. Any of your teachers
can use writing coach. I'm talking a music teacher,
science teacher, ELA teacher. But this was designed
by our product manager, who was a former ELA teacher. And also did you know that
students in high school should be writing for 60 minutes a day? Are your students writing
for 60 minutes a day? Yeah, I'm just, everyone's like, ""Hmm, no, Danielle, they are not."" So the way this works, we designed this as a
true instructional tool. You can assign the essay. So you can, you put the
assignment title, the grade level, what type of essay,
any type of information that you wanna put in there. And then when students have it, they will have a list of essays. And this is what their
experience looks like. First of all, Khanmigo is here to help them understand the prompt, like explain the essay type,
what are their requirements, help me understand what
I'm supposed to do here. Then, the students actually
outline right in Khanmigo in Writing coach. And then, they have
Khanmigo here to help them if they wanna check the
outline, they're stuck. They're struggling with a thesis. They're struggling with
any of the information. But Khanmigo is not going
to give them a thesis. Right here, like gimme a thesis. ""I can't provide a thesis for you, but I can help you refine your ideas."" Then students go into drafting mode. And another guardrail
we have is if students are typing into Khanmigo, and then go home and cut and paste their entire essay from ChatGPT-4, it will flag it for teachers. And the final piece is the revision piece. So, this is going to give
some suggestions on revision, but it's not gonna grade
it for the teachers. But the teachers can use our rubric tools to create rubrics to
help grade the essays. So, this is all available to your students through Khanmigo, the
student facing tutor, both alongside Khan Academy content, and then all of these learner activities. Questions about that before
we go on to the teacher piece? I know this is fast and furious y'all, but okay, we have 10 minutes left. Okay, gotta speed it up even more. So the next piece, I know it's December. If you are a teacher, you
might be feeling like this. If you are a leader, you're
probably feeling like this. So, what we designed are a bunch of tools to help save you time. So, our teacher tools live right here. And then, most of these were free, are free for any teacher in US, but part of the partnership, you get an extra added ChatGPT for Omni. You also have the ability
to summarize the students, understand what students are
talking to Khanmigo about using AI. And then, you also have access to what's called companion mode. So, those are all part
of the paid partnership. And these tools, again, we're
gonna give you lots of time and lots of opportunities
to learn about these, but that they're tools
to like exit tickets, and discussion prompts, and lesson plans, ways to differentiate,
ways to support students. But I wanna show you the
class snapshot real quick, because when students are
working through the digital SAT, or if you're using any
Khan Academy content every, this data will update every seven days. So, what you can do is say, Khanmigo, what are the students
doing in digital SAT? It'll tell you how many
minutes, how many assignments, how many skills, but the
magic is the next steps. Because a lot of times for high school, you know that you wanna do
small group instruction, but sometimes, you don't have time, or you don't have the data, or you don't have the right resources. So this, I'm asking Khanmigo to group my students based on this data. Not only can I assign
this back to the students, but here's where you can
use the teacher AI tools. So now I'm like, ""This is great, but I wanna do something fun in class around this numbers of
solution to equation challenge, knowing that half the kids in my class need to work on this."" So now, I'm like, ""Give me student centered
station rotations dealing with winter or football,"" or any type of, anything
that you can think of that would engage the students. So now, I'm using the teacher tools to have really fun hot
cocoa equation stations, winter world problem stations. So now, we have some station rotations for students based on this content. We also have the teacher tools embedded throughout Khan Academy. So if you wanted to create
an Exit Ticket, Lesson Hook, we're trying to make
things a lot easier for you at point of use. Questions about that very fast. All right, last two pieces. How are we setting you up
to support you with the SAT? Because that is the big
push for this partnership. We are going to give
you lots of information, lots of guidance, and lots of support, including what's the best way to implement this from the SAT prep class, summer school programs, data trackers. We also will advise you through different
implementation strategies like how are we going
to really maximize time for students to have these tools? How can you also supplement your core ELA and math instruction with these tools? And then, the role of the teacher from good, better, and best. Like what's the best way to do this? What should you be doing? What should your students be doing? And then, we give you
resources for students. Because Khanmigo is built on OpenAI, the more specific you
can be with Khanmigo, the better the feedback will be. That is both the teacher
tools and the student tools. So, we have support around all of that. And then especially
supporting with small groups, because high school is the
new middle school after COVID. I'm sure y'all have felt that. So, we wanna give you options on to maximize learning
environments with students. So, all of this is rolled
into our district partnership. So again, you are supported with our team. Sarah Thaler is your
district success manager. She used to work at College Board. She's amazing. Diona Clingman is your professional
development specialist. Also amazing. Ton of background and supports. Both were former educators, current educators, the whole thing. And you also have Brian and
I to round out the team. And then, the partnership could not be complete without RIDE. Like Mike said, this is the team that's gonna support you
on the Rhode Island side. And as part of the
partnership, you get access to all of our Khan Academy content. You have a district dashboard
that's going to give you data around Khan Academy content,
as well as Khanmigo. You have Khanmigo teacher tools and then the student Socratic tutor, the implementation guidance. And we have specific
Rhode Island guidance. So, once you sign up with us and we start getting you rostered, you'll also have access to our professional learning pacing guide, what to expect as part of the
partnership, goal setting. The professional learning is
going to be all year round. We're starting with some
amazing recording courses tailored for SAT from Diona, including SAT Prep Part 1 and
2, how to monitor progress, and then actually how to
prepare for the assessment. All of this is wrapped into a program that has safety security guardrails, moderating tools, et cetera, and the specific RIDE approved
data privacy agreement. You just need to have Clever or ClassLink for rostering, Clever or ClassLink. If for some reason you
don't have one or the other, Clever is free. So, we can help you make sure
you set up a Clever account. But I think most of the
schools have Clever actually. Clever, ClassLink. And again, here are the steps. You're gonna fill out that form. First off, if you're a
yes, fill out the form. If you still need to meet with me, feel free to meet with me. You can book time with me from the... Brian, there's a great
question if you in the chat while I'm still, I'm just finished this because we only have five minutes left. I'll come back to you Nita, okay. So first, you're gonna
request the contract, then it's gonna take a couple days. So, we have to go through a
little process on our end. Then once you return the contract to us, we will get you rostering. Then, you'll decide when
you want it activated and we'll get you to the learning. So, how do you do all of this? You sign up before January 15th, y'all. You can go to this QR code. Brian put the link in the chat. And then this is again, this
will be our one stop shop for everything Rhode Island. So this blog, please bookmark it because this will be,
excuse me, I'm so excited. Lemme just take a drink of water. We will have the video of
this learning series here. We'll have the slide deck
that I've been using. But everything you need
to know is on this blog. And again, this is what
the Contract Request Form looks like. And we really want you to
sign up before January 15th. I think I said 17th and 15th
on two different slides. So, you get it. Before mid-January is when
we want you to sign up. And in conclusion, as a nonprofit, our goal is to support
you and your students to drive deep student learning. We appreciate you. We're so
excited for you to join us. And here is my contact information if you have any questions
or further anything. So, I'm gonna stop the recording. Yes, we'll share the slides
on that website too, Vanessa. Okay, stop the, I'm
gonna stop the recording, answer some of these
questions, so gimme a second. Great.",Khan Academy Districts Program,"Khan Academy Districts Program is a comprehensive support system for districts, providing access to high-quality educational content, personalized learning experiences, and professional development opportunities.",00:04:00 - 00:05:00,2024-12-17T19:16:33Z,8871,99,11
Rhode Island and Khan Academy Info Session,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7McrG9taZak,"- Recording. All right, good morning, good morning. Welcome to our Khan Academy Khanmigo Rhode Island Partnership webinar. Before we get started, this
is a very important question. How are you feeling on
a scale of my dog, Luna? Whatever you say is correct. Just put some numbers in there. I'm feeling five to be here,
but nine for this week. Three is the winner, I know. She was such a grumpy unicorn. She's so hilarious that I had
to make a mood meter of her 'cause this is literally
like I've never seen a dog more expressive than my dog. All right, we got some nines, some tens. All right, all right, great.
- What is she doing in five? Is that a bath? Is that like a pool? - It's a kitty litter box, and it was a hundred degrees in Florida, so we filled it with water. And she was so happy to get in there and just, yep, she took a bath. (laughs) This number four was her during COVID. Eight, somebody put
birthday stuff on her lawn and she didn't know what
that was, so she was like, ""What is this?"" So, that picture just cracks me up. All right, well, good morning everyone. We are so excited to have you on this call to learn about our partnership. My name is Danielle Sullivan. I am the northeast manager
of district partnerships for Khan Academy. I am just part of your
amazing Rhode Island team. I'm joined today by Brian
Carter. I'll let him say hello. - Hey, everybody. Brian Carter. I'm based in Atlanta. I lead the strategic partnership work and we're really excited
to talk to you today about this new partnership with College Board, RIDE, and you all. - And then, you also
have two other members of the Khan Academy team that
you'll be definitely meeting and engaging with. Dr. Sarah Thaler, she's gonna be your district success manager. She actually used to
work for College Board. And then, Diona Clingman is your amazing professional
development specialist. So we make up your Khan
Academy Rhode Island team, but none of this could have been possible without the amazing support of RIDE. So, I want just Mike to say
hello and talk about his team. - Hi. Good morning, everyone. Greetings from the
Nursing Education Center Downtown, Providence here. And I'm happy to be joining you and joining this project with you. On our screen are the people from RIDE that make up the team that can assist you. One is Lisa Odom-Villella. She's the deputy commissioner
for Instructional Programs. Then Steve Osborn, who's our
state state strategy officer and student opportunities. I'm the director of the Office of College
and Career Readiness. And Melissa Kusinitz is our ED specialist. So, Melissa and I are
the leads on the project. So, we are here for every
step of the way for you and if you need anything,
you know where we are and please let us know and contact us. - Thank you so much, Mike. So, we are so excited to let
you know that it's official. There is a partnership
between Khan Academy, RIDE, and College Board. And what that means is you get the Khan
Academy Districts Program, plus Khanmigo for students,
free for the next 18 months. It is normally $15 per student, but with through this partnership,
you are getting it free. Yes, free is the optimal word. So today, we're gonna show you
a little bit about the tools you're gonna be using and
talk about the partnership. But if you are like,
""Yes, how do I sign up?"" You can go ahead and take
a picture of this QR code, but Brian put the link in the chat. This is going to bring
you to our landing page for Rhode Island, where
you can select to sign up through a Contract Request Form, which is going to look like this. You just have to fill in some
information of your district. And yes, there is some billing. We asked for the billing and
the superintendent's name, but that you're not getting charged. We're asking that just for
our contracting purposes. So if you are a yes, please
go ahead and fill this out. We really wanna sign up
partners before January 15th, so you can take advantage of all the tools I'm about to show you for the second half of this school year, and
then all of next school year. And the process will be,
once you fill out that form, it's gonna take a couple of days. We'll get the contract out to you. You've returned the contract to us. We will immediately start
you in the rostering process. You'll just let us know which day you wanna activate your accounts, and then you get to learning. So, the process is pretty seamless. And we do have a Data Privacy Agreement that has been approved by RIDE. The instructions are here. I'll go over those in a second. But you can also see the instructions on the the Contract Request Form, as well as that landing page. Basically, you need an SDPC account. You're gonna log in and
see the Khan Academy for district's DPA in
the resource registry. Our DPA's available through the SDPC Auto Exhibit E Creator. And if you get confused at all, it is part of the tech consortium. So, that's where you have to log in. But again, these instructions are on the Contract Request Form. This video will be on,
once we finish today, we'll have a recording of
this on our landing page, and then all of the slides will
be on the landing page too. So again, sign up before January 15th. Questions about any of that, you can put 'em in the chat. But then, I'm gonna spend the rest of our 25 minutes together talking about the tools
and resources you will get as part of this Khan Academy, RIDE, College Board partnership. We're gonna go over why
learning's important and how AI can help, how
we're saving teachers time, what are the goals for
success for the SAT pieces. And then again, I'm
gonna go over the details of the partnership. Great. ""If districts already completed this, then teachers do,"" correct, Jennifer. Yep. If your teachers wanna watch
the video, that's fine, but we have a lot of PL that will roll out once we
have districts signed up. So first, I wanna just talk through who are we at Khan Academy, right? So Khan Academy is a nonprofit, and our mission is to provide

computer just a little bit. He's a little quiet. - Hi, Rhode Island district leaders. Sal here from Khan Academy. And I just wanted to let you know about a very exciting partnership that I think you will be interested in. And it is a three-way
partnership between Khan Academy, the College Board, the creators of the SAT and other assessments, and your state and the
state of Rhode Island. And this is the only partnership
like this on the planet. And the goal of it is to help ensure that your students are

the journey with you as well. So, let's dig into what
you are going to get as part of the partnership. First, I wanna talk about learning and AI. So, another quick assessment. How are you feeling about AI in general on a scale of hose in the face, Terminator like or GEICO pig excited? And whatever you say is correct. You can hold up a number if you're like... Okay, we got some
excited, some pig excited. That's exciting. I feel we got some threes, some twos. Sometimes, I'm in the middle, like I'm excited about our tools, but sometimes when I see
new AI tools, I'm like, ""What's it gonna look like?"" Great, so we're a little
all over the board. Perfect. Well hopefully after you
start to use Khanmigo, you're gonna feel a little
bit more GEICO pig excited. So, I wanna talk about
learning for a minute the act of learning. I'm not talking about teaching. Just think about students in classrooms. Learning is messy, loud, unpredictable, and extraordinarily vulnerable. We are asking kids to show
up, admit they don't know, make mistakes all in front of their peers. And we know based on research that students will learn more
when they're actively engaged in the material. When they're it's right at
the edge of struggle, right? It can't be too easy, too hard. When they get immediate feedback. And they also need to see the
value of what they're learning and have it applied to
what they're interested in. Oftentimes, I've gone through schools and seen all these great posters about learning and growth mindset, but then classrooms look like this. Or more importantly, or actually more challengingly, that's a new word for

the SAT course this morning, but know you have lots and lots of options to enhance with Khan Academy content. But Khanmigo works alongside
our Khan Academy content. There are learning activities, and then there are teacher activities. So, let me show you what it looks like when
students are taking anything in the digital SAT. So if I am taking an activity around the Foundations of Algebra and I am doing a problem on understanding the systems of linear equations and foundations, and I'm stuck. I don't know what to answer. I don't just wanna guess. This is where Khanmigo comes in. Lives right here on the right
hand side of your screen. I'm gonna make this a little bit bigger. So the first off, I'm just point
out a couple of guardrails. We do not want students to
share personal information. We don't collect it. We don't want them to share it. Secondly, the chat is logged, but it's logged for you to mine as data. We'll log it for one academic year, but we're not sharing
this back out with OpenAI. We have text to speech, speech to text, and then Khanmigo speaks English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hindu fluently. But it can translate in
other languages as well. So, the first thing
that kids might ask is, ""Why do I even care about understanding solving systems of linear equations?"" There are prompts for students
if they want them turned on, but again, you saw that
little calculating math. We built another layer of AI to help minimize math
mistakes in particular. So Khanmigo says, ""Understanding
systems of linear equations are important because it helps
solve real world problems. Check out this video to
see why it's important."" So students could say, ""Gimme an example,"" ""What are the steps,""
""I don't understand,"" or ""Give me the answer,"" which is what a lot of kids will do next. It's great. I just tell me what to do. This is not, Khanmigo is
not going to give students the answer. It is going to help them understand what they think the answer is. So, it can be differentiate in the moment. It can make things a little
bit easier for students. It can make things harder or even relate this to football for me. And look, spelling does not matter. Khanmigo can also speak text, like IDK and all of the things. So now, what it's doing, because I told Khanmigo that
I'm interested in football, it's gonna start relating
this to football. Like think of an equation as a
strategy for a football game. I can even have it
relate to more football. So if I'm somebody who loves football and can understand that,
but struggling with math, this is what we were talking about and making it relevant
and engaging for students. So, this is one way you can use Khanmigo alongside Khan Academy content. But we also have many
other learner activities using Khanmigo for students. The first section is the Tutor Me section. So, this is an opportunity
to have that Socratic tutor with other content beyond Khan Academy. So, and teachers are actually
can assign this content to students. So, I was working with a
science teacher in New York who was assigning Tutor Me Science to have students research lunar cycles before she was teaching that. So, that's just one aspect
of how you can utilize this. And students can open this up and use this with any type
of work that they're doing. We also have practicing knowledge. So, students can actually get
quizzed on certain topics. They can practice for AP exams. They can debate Khanmigo on a variety of topics for high school. They can chat with literary characters and historical figures. So, I was actually working
with a high school teacher who's about to teach ""Macbeth."" So, she was having her
students chat with Macbeth to learn more or even
after they read something, like if after you read
""Pride and Prejudice,"" you can have come in
and talk to Mr. Darcy. I have a lot of, there's a lot of social
studies and science teachers who are utilizing Chatting
with historical figures. I had a social or a science
teacher assign students to talk to Albert Einstein
about thermodynamics. So, it's really interesting
and creative the way that you can utilize these tools. There are additional
vocabulary activities, options for students to explore
college and career ready or just future career growth. But I wanna point out Writing coach because this I don't know if you saw, but we were on ""60 Minutes,"" on Sunday. I'm surprised how many people
still watch ""60 Minutes,"" to be quite honest. But I think it's kind
of in between football, so people just were really excited. But then, we did have a
great piece with Rhode Island about the partnership. Brian just put that link in the chat. So, we did feature Writing coach. So what Writing coach is it's available 7th through 12th grade. Any of your teachers
can use writing coach. I'm talking a music teacher,
science teacher, ELA teacher. But this was designed
by our product manager, who was a former ELA teacher. And also did you know that
students in high school should be writing for 60 minutes a day? Are your students writing
for 60 minutes a day? Yeah, I'm just, everyone's like, ""Hmm, no, Danielle, they are not."" So the way this works, we designed this as a
true instructional tool. You can assign the essay. So you can, you put the
assignment title, the grade level, what type of essay,
any type of information that you wanna put in there. And then when students have it, they will have a list of essays. And this is what their
experience looks like. First of all, Khanmigo is here to help them understand the prompt, like explain the essay type,
what are their requirements, help me understand what
I'm supposed to do here. Then, the students actually
outline right in Khanmigo in Writing coach. And then, they have
Khanmigo here to help them if they wanna check the
outline, they're stuck. They're struggling with a thesis. They're struggling with
any of the information. But Khanmigo is not going
to give them a thesis. Right here, like gimme a thesis. ""I can't provide a thesis for you, but I can help you refine your ideas."" Then students go into drafting mode. And another guardrail
we have is if students are typing into Khanmigo, and then go home and cut and paste their entire essay from ChatGPT-4, it will flag it for teachers. And the final piece is the revision piece. So, this is going to give
some suggestions on revision, but it's not gonna grade
it for the teachers. But the teachers can use our rubric tools to create rubrics to
help grade the essays. So, this is all available to your students through Khanmigo, the
student facing tutor, both alongside Khan Academy content, and then all of these learner activities. Questions about that before
we go on to the teacher piece? I know this is fast and furious y'all, but okay, we have 10 minutes left. Okay, gotta speed it up even more. So the next piece, I know it's December. If you are a teacher, you
might be feeling like this. If you are a leader, you're
probably feeling like this. So, what we designed are a bunch of tools to help save you time. So, our teacher tools live right here. And then, most of these were free, are free for any teacher in US, but part of the partnership, you get an extra added ChatGPT for Omni. You also have the ability
to summarize the students, understand what students are
talking to Khanmigo about using AI. And then, you also have access to what's called companion mode. So, those are all part
of the paid partnership. And these tools, again, we're
gonna give you lots of time and lots of opportunities
to learn about these, but that they're tools
to like exit tickets, and discussion prompts, and lesson plans, ways to differentiate,
ways to support students. But I wanna show you the
class snapshot real quick, because when students are
working through the digital SAT, or if you're using any
Khan Academy content every, this data will update every seven days. So, what you can do is say, Khanmigo, what are the students
doing in digital SAT? It'll tell you how many
minutes, how many assignments, how many skills, but the
magic is the next steps. Because a lot of times for high school, you know that you wanna do
small group instruction, but sometimes, you don't have time, or you don't have the data, or you don't have the right resources. So this, I'm asking Khanmigo to group my students based on this data. Not only can I assign
this back to the students, but here's where you can
use the teacher AI tools. So now I'm like, ""This is great, but I wanna do something fun in class around this numbers of
solution to equation challenge, knowing that half the kids in my class need to work on this."" So now, I'm like, ""Give me student centered
station rotations dealing with winter or football,"" or any type of, anything
that you can think of that would engage the students. So now, I'm using the teacher tools to have really fun hot
cocoa equation stations, winter world problem stations. So now, we have some station rotations for students based on this content. We also have the teacher tools embedded throughout Khan Academy. So if you wanted to create
an Exit Ticket, Lesson Hook, we're trying to make
things a lot easier for you at point of use. Questions about that very fast. All right, last two pieces. How are we setting you up
to support you with the SAT? Because that is the big
push for this partnership. We are going to give
you lots of information, lots of guidance, and lots of support, including what's the best way to implement this from the SAT prep class, summer school programs, data trackers. We also will advise you through different
implementation strategies like how are we going
to really maximize time for students to have these tools? How can you also supplement your core ELA and math instruction with these tools? And then, the role of the teacher from good, better, and best. Like what's the best way to do this? What should you be doing? What should your students be doing? And then, we give you
resources for students. Because Khanmigo is built on OpenAI, the more specific you
can be with Khanmigo, the better the feedback will be. That is both the teacher
tools and the student tools. So, we have support around all of that. And then especially
supporting with small groups, because high school is the
new middle school after COVID. I'm sure y'all have felt that. So, we wanna give you options on to maximize learning
environments with students. So, all of this is rolled
into our district partnership. So again, you are supported with our team. Sarah Thaler is your
district success manager. She used to work at College Board. She's amazing. Diona Clingman is your professional
development specialist. Also amazing. Ton of background and supports. Both were former educators, current educators, the whole thing. And you also have Brian and
I to round out the team. And then, the partnership could not be complete without RIDE. Like Mike said, this is the team that's gonna support you
on the Rhode Island side. And as part of the
partnership, you get access to all of our Khan Academy content. You have a district dashboard
that's going to give you data around Khan Academy content,
as well as Khanmigo. You have Khanmigo teacher tools and then the student Socratic tutor, the implementation guidance. And we have specific
Rhode Island guidance. So, once you sign up with us and we start getting you rostered, you'll also have access to our professional learning pacing guide, what to expect as part of the
partnership, goal setting. The professional learning is
going to be all year round. We're starting with some
amazing recording courses tailored for SAT from Diona, including SAT Prep Part 1 and
2, how to monitor progress, and then actually how to
prepare for the assessment. All of this is wrapped into a program that has safety security guardrails, moderating tools, et cetera, and the specific RIDE approved
data privacy agreement. You just need to have Clever or ClassLink for rostering, Clever or ClassLink. If for some reason you
don't have one or the other, Clever is free. So, we can help you make sure
you set up a Clever account. But I think most of the
schools have Clever actually. Clever, ClassLink. And again, here are the steps. You're gonna fill out that form. First off, if you're a
yes, fill out the form. If you still need to meet with me, feel free to meet with me. You can book time with me from the... Brian, there's a great
question if you in the chat while I'm still, I'm just finished this because we only have five minutes left. I'll come back to you Nita, okay. So first, you're gonna
request the contract, then it's gonna take a couple days. So, we have to go through a
little process on our end. Then once you return the contract to us, we will get you rostering. Then, you'll decide when
you want it activated and we'll get you to the learning. So, how do you do all of this? You sign up before January 15th, y'all. You can go to this QR code. Brian put the link in the chat. And then this is again, this
will be our one stop shop for everything Rhode Island. So this blog, please bookmark it because this will be,
excuse me, I'm so excited. Lemme just take a drink of water. We will have the video of
this learning series here. We'll have the slide deck
that I've been using. But everything you need
to know is on this blog. And again, this is what
the Contract Request Form looks like. And we really want you to
sign up before January 15th. I think I said 17th and 15th
on two different slides. So, you get it. Before mid-January is when
we want you to sign up. And in conclusion, as a nonprofit, our goal is to support
you and your students to drive deep student learning. We appreciate you. We're so
excited for you to join us. And here is my contact information if you have any questions
or further anything. So, I'm gonna stop the recording. Yes, we'll share the slides
on that website too, Vanessa. Okay, stop the, I'm
gonna stop the recording, answer some of these
questions, so gimme a second. Great.",Khan Academy Rhode Island Team,"The Rhode Island team from Khan Academy consists of Danielle Sullivan (Northeast Manager of District Partnerships), Brian Carter (Strategic Partnership Leader), Dr.",00:05:00 - 00:06:00,2024-12-17T19:16:33Z,8871,99,11

Khanmigo Lesson Hooks with Mrs. Higgason!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7rO9BzXsj4,"- Hi, teachers. My name is Melissa Higgason and I'm a high school
teacher here in Indiana. You might recognize me from this recent episode of ""60 Minutes"" or this video from Microsoft. I'm not an actress. I'm a real life classroom
teacher just like you. You've seen me talk about Khanmigo and the amazing impact it's had in helping bring out the joy
in learning for my students. Today, I wanna show you some of my own tips and tricks with using Khanmigo to help you boost your
own teaching potential. One of my favorite Khanmigo teacher tools to help me free up time for interaction with my students is the
lesson hook feature. Let me show you how to use it. I'm getting ready to start a unit in my high school chemistry
class on periodic trends, and I'm looking for a way to peak my students'
interest in the topic, so I'm gonna head over
to high school chemistry and just see what content
is already available for me because this is usually
a great starting point. Atomic radii is really
what I wanna start with. It looks like there's a
video and a practice in here. But I'm looking for something really just to peak their interest, so I'm gonna go ahead and click into Khanmigo teacher tools, lesson hook, and this is already pre-populated. Learn about how atomic size varies across periods and down groups. Perfect, let's see what ideas
Khanmigo has for me today. I love this idea. I just don't have access to
these things in my classroom, so I am just going to discuss this. I am going to just talk with Khanmigo now and say that I would like to make this a paper-pencil activity, and so it's giving me two ideas. They're given a list of elements, along with their relative
atomic radii in centimeters, and ask them to draw circles
to represent the atoms. I love this idea. I don't wanna create a document on this. I want Khanmigo to help
me create a document, so I'm going to expand on this idea. So I said, ""Can you provide a list ""of relative atomic radii in centimeters ""for periods one through three only?"" Again, I don't want this
to take a long time. ""Have the students use
the links as diameters,"" again, for the sake of time. ""Make the measurements
compatible with a standard ruler. ""Create a student facing document ""to incorporate all this information,"" because I don't wanna create the document, so let's just see what it comes up with. I try to be as specific as possible, but I can always cater
it later, if I need to, if I'm not 100% happy with
what it comes up with. Oh my goodness, I love this. Okay, so use the elements below. You're gonna use this as a diameter, exactly what I asked it to do. You're gonna make circles,
and here's period one. These measurements are totally manageable for my students with a regular
ruler, so this is great. And there's even some discussion questions about the patterns and
how the radii are changing as you move down a group
and across periods. So this is perfect. My last step here literally would be just to copy and paste this
into a Google Doc to copy or move it into my learning
management system for students. Thank you for watching this video, and I hope it helps you in your classroom. - [Announcer] To try out

Debugging with test cases | Intro to CS - Python | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmRjbVIZ0s,"- [Instructor] Let's apply test cases to debug a racing game. Our game prototype has two cars that race on a straight track. Each round the cars move forward
a random number of spaces and whichever car passes the
end of the track first wins. Let's take a look at
the code we have so far. We use a while loop to repeat
rounds until the race is over. On each iteration we move the cars, we print the status of the race, and we display the track state. When I run it, it kind of
seems like this game works, but there does seem to
maybe be a little bug here. On the last round, it seems like cars are sometimes disappearing from the track, so maybe I'm missing something
in my display function. I'm gonna open up the track module to see how this display function works. It takes in the positions of the two cars and the length of the track and it returns out a string
drawing of the track state. Seems reasonable, but
what's going wrong then? To narrow this down, I'm going to test the display
function in isolation. So I'll pop back over to main.py and run through a few test cases. There's the case where
the first car is ahead. There's the case where
the second car is ahead. There's a case where both cars I guess are on the same position of the track and then there's the end case where a car is beyond the end of the track. Okay, let's see what values we get back. I'm gonna comment out
this game loop for now because its output is
a little distracting. It looks like a car is
disappearing in two test cases, so lucky us, maybe we
have two bugs to fix. Let's start with the last case where a car's position is
greater than the track length. What do we want to happen in this case? Well, I'd like to still
see where the car is, so maybe we just keep drawing until we reach the furthest position. Right now our draw loop
only goes up to the length of the track, but plus one
since range is exclusive. So if the track length is five and car one is at position seven, then we wanna keep drawing segments until we pass position seven. So really the end of the range should be whichever is greater, the position of car one
or the end of the track. But car two might also be the furthest, so we should really take the
maximum of all three positions. Hmm, let's see if that fixed the problem. And let's double check the case where car two is the furthest. Whew. That's three test cases passing now. So let's wrap this up by fixing the case where the cars are at the
same position on the track. Right now it looks like
display is only showing the symbol for car one. What do we expect? Well, it's not all that obvious. One solution might be to
just draw a different symbol that indicates both
cars are on that space. I can change the symbol later, but for now, let's just say I draw an X. So let's go back to our display function and see what we need to modify. It looks like this nested function call controls which symbol we
draw for each segment. So we need to update the get
symbol for space function to handle that X case. If car one and car two's
position are the same, then we return an X. Ooh, everything is an
X now, what did we do? It seems like for every
segment get symbol for space is returning X. Hmm, we do need to check that car one and car two are at the same position, but we also need to check
that that's the position we're currently trying
to get the symbol for. It doesn't matter if car one and car two are both at position five if right now we're
trying to get the symbol for position one. So to draw an X, all three of these values
should be the same, which we can verify by
checking that position equals equals car one. Alright, all four test cases are passing. I'm fairly confident that the
display function works now, so let's put the game back together. I'll clean up those test cases and uncomment out the game loop. The next time you encounter
a bug in your program, try narrowing it down to the
individual function level and hopefully you'll have
an easier time debugging just that one unit of code.",Testing Display Function,The instructor tests the display function in isolation to identify bugs that cause cars to disappear from the track.,00:00:00 - 00:03:12,2024-11-26T06:00:56Z,12174,145,6

function in isolation. So I'll pop back over to main.py and run through a few test cases. There's the case where
the first car is ahead. There's the case where
the second car is ahead. There's a case where both cars I guess are on the same position of the track and then there's the end case where a car is beyond the end of the track. Okay, let's see what values we get back. I'm gonna comment out
this game loop for now because its output is
a little distracting. It looks like a car is
disappearing in two test cases, so lucky us, maybe we
have two bugs to fix. Let's start with the last case where a car's position is
greater than the track length. What do we want to happen in this case? Well, I'd like to still
see where the car is, so maybe we just keep drawing until we reach the furthest position. Right now our draw loop
only goes up to the length of the track, but plus one
since range is exclusive. So if the track length is five and car one is at position seven, then we wanna keep drawing segments until we pass position seven. So really the end of the range should be whichever is greater, the position of car one
or the end of the track. But car two might also be the furthest, so we should really take the
maximum of all three positions. Hmm, let's see if that fixed the problem. And let's double check the case where car two is the furthest. Whew. That's three test cases passing now. So let's wrap this up by fixing the case where the cars are at the
same position on the track. Right now it looks like
display is only showing the symbol for car one. What do we expect? Well, it's not all that obvious. One solution might be to
just draw a different symbol that indicates both
cars are on that space. I can change the symbol later, but for now, let's just say I draw an X. So let's go back to our display function and see what we need to modify. It looks like this nested function call controls which symbol we
draw for each segment. So we need to update the get
symbol for space function to handle that X case. If car one and car two's
position are the same, then we return an X. Ooh, everything is an
X now, what did we do? It seems like for every
segment get symbol for space is returning X. Hmm, we do need to check that car one and car two are at the same position, but we also need to check
that that's the position we're currently trying
to get the symbol for. It doesn't matter if car one and car two are both at position five if right now we're
trying to get the symbol for position one. So to draw an X, all three of these values
should be the same, which we can verify by
checking that position equals equals car one. Alright, all four test cases are passing. I'm fairly confident that the
display function works now, so let's put the game back together. I'll clean up those test cases and uncomment out the game loop. The next time you encounter
a bug in your program, try narrowing it down to the
individual function level and hopefully you'll have
an easier time debugging just that one unit of code.",Debugging Racing Game,The instructor discovers a bug in their racing game prototype that causes cars to disappear from the track on the last round.,00:03:12 - 00:06:24,2024-11-26T06:00:56Z,12174,145,6
Debugging with test cases | Intro to CS - Python | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmRjbVIZ0s,"- [Instructor] Let's apply test cases to debug a racing game. Our game prototype has two cars that race on a straight track. Each round the cars move forward
a random number of spaces and whichever car passes the
end of the track first wins. Let's take a look at
the code we have so far. We use a while loop to repeat
rounds until the race is over. On each iteration we move the cars, we print the status of the race, and we display the track state. When I run it, it kind of
seems like this game works, but there does seem to
maybe be a little bug here. On the last round, it seems like cars are sometimes disappearing from the track, so maybe I'm missing something
in my display function. I'm gonna open up the track module to see how this display function works. It takes in the positions of the two cars and the length of the track and it returns out a string
drawing of the track state. Seems reasonable, but
what's going wrong then? To narrow this down, I'm going to test the display
function in isolation. So I'll pop back over to main.py and run through a few test cases. There's the case where

Unit testing | Intro to CS - Python | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OmfTIf-SOU,"- [Instructor] You've
broken your program down into functions, but now maybe
you have 100's of functions, and a team of programmers
is in there every day making changes to the code. With all of these moving
pieces, how is it possible that this program isn't constantly broken? The secret? Testing. Tests can come in many forms, like performance tests
or end-to-end tests. But the most common is unit testing. Unit tests test a single unit
of functionality at a time. In most cases, that unit is a function. With unit tests, we can
define the requirements for a function in code. For example, my unit test might validate that when I call my function
with the arguments 5 wheat and 1 ore that I get
the return value false. If that assertion is correct
and I do get back false, then the test passes. But if we get a different return
value from the one the test expects, then the test fails. Teams can automate their unit test to run anytime someone makes a
change to the function and they can block that
change from being submitted until all the related unit tests pass. This effectively enforces the requirements so programmers don't
accidentally break things when they make a change. Either we fix the function
to make the unit test pass, or if we thought twice about it and we're confident that it's safe to change the requirements,
then we can update the unit test to reflect that new expected behavior and submit that along
with our code change. That way the unit tests
stay a living contract of the functions requirements. But how do I know which tests to write? Writing just one test case
doesn't really do a whole lot because my unit test would still pass even if my function just
always returned four. So I haven't really proven
anything about my function logic. I could write a test for
every possible input value, but that's probably not the
most efficient use of my time. Instead, programmers try and work for a goal of code coverage. As a whole, we want our test
cases to execute every possible path of execution through the function. So we try and identify
different classes of inputs, and write a test case for each of those. For example, with our
get_route_score function we would at least want a test case for each of these conditional branches. So our classes of inputs would be less than or equal to 2
trains, 3 trains, 4 trains, and greater than or equal to 5 trains. With those representative
inputs we've anticipated and proven out all the reasonable ways that someone might call our function. Of course, the testing
process isn't always perfect. We may miss a test case, or we might make
compromises on code coverage in the interest of time. If we do find a bug later,
we just wanna make sure we learn from that mistake. So most programming teams will go back in and add a test for that exact failure case to enforce that the same
bug never happens twice. Okay, great, but how do I
actually write unit tests? The principles stay the same, but the exact syntax varies depending on which unit
testing framework you use. in Python, many programmers
use the unittest module or the pytest module. Here's an example test suite written with the unittest framework. I have seven test cases, and you can see that they're
basically all the same. I only change the name,
the argument I pass to the get_route_score function, and the expected result I compare to. When I run it, I can see that one of my test cases is failing. It tells me the name of
the failing test case and the assertion that failed. Here I got the result -2
instead of the expected 0. So I know my function
must have a bug somewhere because it doesn't work when I call it with a negative argument. As you can see, a lot of unit testing code is just boilerplate. That is, the same
repeated required syntax, so a lot of programmers
will just copy and paste the boiler plate. That means the secret to unit testing isn't so much memorizing the syntax as it is learning how to
identify interesting test cases. If you're a beginner programmer
working independently just to learn, then I'll be
honest, it may not be worth it to write unit tests for all
your code at this point, because writing test code
can often take just as long as it takes to write the program code. However, it is worth your time
to think about test cases. When you write or change a function, it's a good habit to call it
with a few different arguments to verify that it works as expected, even if you're not automating
that process with unit tests. That way as we build out
the rest of our program, we can have confidence that
the individual functions work correctly and when
we inevitably encounter an error later, we can
rule out those functions as the cause of the bug.",Unit Testing,"Unit testing involves testing individual units of functionality, typically functions.",00:00:00 - 00:05:00,2024-11-20T02:50:29Z,9950,176,4

AI for Writing: A Deep Dive for Administrators,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TonUa-uB8hY,"- Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining. We'll get started in
about a minute and a half. Thanks for being with us. If you wanna share where
you're calling in from, that would be great to see. And I would also love
to know what drew you to this seminar today. Is it specifically ELA? Is it Sarah Robertson? Would love to know what's compelling to you about this topic. Folks just joining,
thank you for being here. If you wanna drop your name in the chat, say where you're coming in from, and also share what drew you to join this conversation
today, that would be great. Okay, so I wanna be
super respectful of time, so we'll get started right away. My name is Aviv Weiss. I'm here with Sarah Robertson. I'm gonna quickly share my screen. Sarah, can you give me a thumbs
up that you see my screen? Okay, perfect. So, I'm here with Sarah Robertson. Sarah taught for 10 years
as an English teacher, has extensive experience in curriculum design and instruction. She and I actually both taught in the same public charter
network well over 10 years ago. Sarah today works on literacy
and classroom experience. You'll see more of sort of
what that work looks like, what it means today. And I've been working, since I left the classroom six years ago, I've been working at Khan Academy. I'm, like, the luckiest
person in the world. It was my first job after
leaving the classroom. And I've been working specifically on the Khan Academy Districts team. So my job has been to bring our services, so professional learning and
strategic implementation, support of Khan Academy, all the content, all the classroom tools to hundreds of school districts across the US. Let's dive right into today's topic, which is progress in the
ELA classroom now that AI is at our fingertips. So before we even talk
about what that means, what that looks like, I do wanna touch on probably the most
important piece to all of us in this room, which is safety. As a nonprofit, Sal Khan and the whole Khan Academy team, we are completely focused
on helping school districts and individual schools
drive deep student learning. AI is one more tool in the toolbox, but I do wanna just take this
opportunity to share that, whether it's Khan Academy or
any other sort of AI provider or vendor, everyone
should, at the very least, have clean SOC 2 type two audits, be FERPA and COPPA compliant, state specific or district-specific
terms of services. These are, like, table stakes things that need to be in place. So I encourage you to learn
more about what that looks like with Khan Academy, given we
have so many free AI tools and anyone else you're working with. And Sarah will show
more, in just a moment, of what moderation technology
that keeps students safe looks like in the writing
coach tool specifically. So let's dive into today's topic. Sarah and I both know, I
think probably especially 'cause we worked for the same
network for a number of years. We would run interim
assessments four times a year, which meant for English
teachers that we had 90 to 100 essays to grade at
least four times in a year. And of course, that was
just for assessments. There was lots of writing that happens throughout a regular school week, but those four times a
year would really kind of focus us on this incredible
problem of not being able to provide meaningful, timely
feedback to our students. And we would sit there
with literal piles of paper and if we were lucky, some pizza, and we knew that we had,
like, 90 minutes to grade before they couldn't keep
us in the building anymore. And then we'd give it back to the students and then maybe we would review in class and run around the classroom, like, with a chicken without its head on, like, trying to quickly
give feedback in the moment. Sarah, you have the opportunity to work on this problem in a
technology development setting. Can you talk to this group to me about how this problem made its way from your real lived life to
what you're working on now at Khan Academy? - Yeah, of course. Thanks everybody for joining. Really excited to talk about this. As Aviv mentioned, I think when we talk about ELA in particular, it is a different ball game
when it comes to the challenges that teachers are facing in classrooms. And I say this as
somebody who left teaching before ChatGPT came out. I mean, I think it starts with the fact that the expectations
are obviously very high. I don't know how well known this is, but the National Commission
on Writing actually recommends that students spend 60
minutes per day writing. This is middle and high school students. That's the recommendation. And grade level writing
standards are pretty high. I can say, you know, having
taught middle school students in Boston, many of my
students came to me well below grade level in
both reading and writing. But I think what makes
writing particularly hard is that the demand of the writing process, writing is very time consuming. And as a teacher, you know,
typically you're working with a class of 25, 30, 30-something kids in the room at a time, and then you might have multiple
sections that you teach. So, you know, I had about 100 students that I was responsible for. And knowing that I needed to
give them not just assessments that, you know, tested
their writing skills, but I needed to give them practice and I didn't just need
to give them practice, I needed to give them
feedback on that practice. That becomes almost
impossible for an ELA teacher to do at the level of 60 minutes a day if you
are giving kids feedback, and kids cannot grow without feedback. And that feedback also, it
can't just be, like, a rubric with some things circled. Like, good feedback is specific, actionable, personalized, and timely, like, delivered in a timely manner so that students can kind
of analyze what they've done and implement changes
immediately in the draft that they've already started and then in future writing as well. But we all know, I mean,
you all are well aware that this is not happening
effectively in many classrooms in the US and I think
once ChatGPT was launched, there became an entirely new challenge that English teachers in particular and humanities teachers faced, which is it becomes really difficult for a humanities teacher to
actually know what content that a student is turning in was created by them versus by AI. I know a lot of teachers who rely on things like AI detectors. Those have proven to be highly ineffective at actually figuring out
what is written by a human and what is written by AI. And so when we saw this
technology, you know, come out, I think the first reaction was, ""Oh no, this makes teaching so much harder."" But at the same time, we
saw potential for a way to solve those problems
that we hadn't had before. So as somebody who's worked
in building EdTech products for ELA teachers now
for almost eight years, I can tell you that when we
saw this technology in action, immediately we began thinking about how the game has changed
for education technology, how the challenges have changed, and how the potential has
changed for what we could build. So at Khan Academy, we saw a really big opportunity in this very specific
area of writing feedback. So we spent actually one week to start prototyping an
experience where we tested what would happen if a student
had access to an AI tool that would help them craft a thesis and not write it for them. So we experimented with this idea and what we found at the end of that week was it was
actually really powerful what we could build if we just kind of prompt engineered the AI
in the ways that we wanted to and builded a product that, and built a product that
wasn't just, you know, a chat bot on the side of a kind of classic learning experience,
but actually integrated into the learning experience for students. So I am gonna jump into the demo of what that initial prototype evolved into, because now it's been, you know, almost two years I think since we started working
on this specific problem of the ELA instruction, the writing instruction for teachers. - Perfect, and Sarah,
while you tee that up, I just wanna remind
everyone the chat is open. While Sarah's showing everything. I'll be looking at the chat and very happy to answer your questions and make sure to get them
up to Sarah afterwards. Please just write them in
the chat, if you don't mind. - All right. Aviv, are you seeing About This Activity? - [Aviv] I am.
- Okay, great. So I'm gonna start from
actually the teacher experience. The teacher experience of Writing Coach, we wanted to treat it as important as the student experience
of Writing Coach, because we still believe
that writing teachers, English teachers, humanities
teachers are going to be the drivers of this learning. We want them to maintain control of what students are writing about, when they wanna assign essays, and beyond that, we wanna
give them the flexibility to define the expectations for assignments and also giving them the
insights and the reporting and the record of what
students worked on in ways that have really never
been possible before. So I'm gonna start from
the teacher experience, just to show you what it
looks like for a teacher who is setting up a Writing
Coach essay assignment. So these are the learning
activities right now for students on Khan
Academy's Khanmigo AI Tutor and Writing Coach is right
here under the write category. So teachers, when they access this page, they see kind of a
teacher-facing informational page that gives them an overview of how Writing Coach works
from a teacher perspective. And then teachers can do things
like preview sample essays under my essays or even
start their own essay if they wanna demo the Writing
Coach experience for students or try it out themselves. My assignments is where they
manage the actual essays that they're assigning to students. So when a teacher wants to create a Writing Coach assignment, they have total control over what students are writing about. So if your teachers are working
off of a specific curriculum that already has writing prompts or they, you know, design
their own writing curriculum, they can use those writing prompts. This is not the kind of
thing where we force you to choose between the
prompts that we've designed. We really leave it up to the teacher to decide what they want to assign. You can also do, you know, find prompts from previous
state writing assessments. If you have state writing assessments, you can literally copy
and paste the essay prompt and instructions into this box. So teachers get to choose
the title of the assignment, they can select from the grade levels. Right now we officially
support grade seven through 12 for Writing Coach. It will work for younger grades, but it isn't exactly calibrated to support really low
level fifth, you know, sixth grade typical writing. I think it would just be
a little bit more advanced for those grade levels. So right now, the official
grades we support are seventh through 12th, but if
you have advanced fifth or sixth graders, there's nothing stopping
them from using this. And then for essay types,
we support the primary kind of academic middle and
high school essay format. So persuasive and argumentative essays, explanatory or expository
essays, and literary analysis. And again, the teacher can just
paste in their essay prompt and instructions here. The more specific these instructions are, the better the experience
will be for students. This is a field that
the AI itself is using to determine how it supports students. So if the teacher says, ""I want students to include a concession and rebuttal paragraph for
this argumentative essay"", that is a sign then to the AI to make sure that students include that when they are writing their
drafts or even their outlines. So the more granular it gets, the more helpful Khanmigo can be. And another example is, you
know, I want my students to use MLA or APA citations,
like, that level of detail is what will help Khanmigo recognize
what the teacher expects and ensure that students
are held to that standard. And then, of course, we have
things like minimum word count and then typical, you know, due dates and those kinds of things. And then I'll jump over
to the student experience. Let me change my window here. Okay, now I'm in a student account. So similarly, the students
have their activities page, but if they're given a
Writing Coach assignment, they'll see it, you know, in their learner homepage
under their assignments queue. But when they go to Writing Coach, they will see their
assignments listed here and they can jump right into them. So this is an example of one
that I've already completed, but Writing Coach for
students is broken down into four main stages
of the writing process. So the first stage that we've
built out is understanding, and this came from a lot
of user research we did with teachers and students,
where they were really clear that when it came to essay
assignments, one of the things that students struggled with
the most was just understanding what the teacher was expecting of them, breaking down the prompt, really figuring out what
the expectations were. Getting help with, like, the
first step of figuring out, do I need to do research? Do I need to find evidence in a text the teacher provided? Do I need to do some brainstorming? And this is where the student gets access to what the teacher assigned, and this is an exact copy of what the teacher
assigned here on the left. And then when students join, they will initially get a
prompt from Khanmigo saying, ""I'm here to help with
essay requirements."" And students can engage with, you know, two recommended chats with Khanmigo about
the essay instructions, or a student can ask
any question about it. So if the student kind of wants to dig into essay requirements, Khanmigo will summarize
them for the student, it will prompt them to figure out if they're ready to move on. So it will follow up with questions like, ""What do I do with.."" ""Well, have you done reading
or research on the topic?"" And then it's, you know, what do you think your
main claim is going to be? And reassuring them if they're confused and encouraging them to take a next step, like, organizing their thoughts, giving them ideas like
mind maps or Venn diagrams. It will react to whatever
the student is saying around whether or not
they have a position. It can define, you know, key terms in the essay
instructions, what does rebut mean, and kind of help them
to figure out, you know, when they're ready to move
on to the second stage, which is outlining. Again, this is a completed
Writing Coach assignment. So a fresh kind of new
Writing Coach assignment, a student would see this
blank essay template and the blank essay template, you know, when there isn't text in here, the student will see
an exemplar, you know, example of a thesis. Same thing for main points
and topics and evidences and examples so that students
can see an expectation of what that might look like, but align it to a completely different essay topic. So we're not gonna, you know, give them something they can copy, but we are gonna show them what, you know, an exemplary main point might look like or thesis statement might look like for that given essay type. And then again, Khanmigo is here, their assignment instructions
are always accessible in the right-hand panel. And Khanmigo will start
with the, ""I'm here."" The next step is outlining. And students can kind
of engage with Khanmigo if they want to or if they're
all set, they don't have to. So the outline is designed
to be really flexible. Students can add or
remove body paragraphs. They can add or remove different
components like evidence and source and reasoning or explanation. We want it to be the
kind of outline format that will support, you know, pretty much any essay structure. And then Khanmigo is there
if a student gets stuck. So if they're blank page,
you know, a little bit, feeling a little paralyzed by what to do, they can just say, ""I'm stuck."" Or if they make a little progress, they can ask Khanmigo to
check their outline so far. Khanmigo is gonna break it down for them if they say they're stuck. It is not going to give them any answers or it's not going to give
them any direct things to include or write. I think in this particular account I'm in, I don't have examples of
the student asking Khanmigo to cheat for them, but I can show you that from the teacher perspective and kind of how that is handled there. But you can see here, in
this case, this is kind of the perspective of a student
who asks a lot of questions. We know that there are also many students who don't ask questions,
but they still have them and they still want to, we still wanna make sure that they are getting checked in on. So another thing that we
do in Writing Coach is when a student moves from
outlining to drafting, let's say they fill out
part of their outline or you know, some of their outline and they try to move on to drafting, even if they're not
asking Khanmigo for help or if they haven't asked for help at all, we are gonna do a behind the
scenes check of that outline and look for is it aligned to
what the teacher asked for? Is it on topic? Did they write an essay, you
know, with a particular thesis but then the body paragraphs
contradict the thesis? Like, it's checking for
general completeness and then also general alignment. It's not gonna go really
deep on the details of how they've expressed their ideas, but it's gonna check for
general alignment to make sure that their outline is complete and that it is aligned to
what the teacher has asked for and the argument they're trying to make. And that will kind of
be a sort of checkpoint before they move on to the next stage. So even though students who
are really not gonna engage or take the initiative
to engage with Khanmigo, they will still have the
opportunity to be followed up with before they move on. The drafting stage is
pretty straightforward. Again, students have access to
their assignment instructions and a Khanmigo chat that's
gonna be there to help them through this particular
stage of the writing. But they also have access to
the outline that they drafted with Khanmigo in the previous stage. And when they have access to this outline, they can copy and paste
chunks of it into their draft, get an updated word count, and begin to construct that first draft. And again, when the student asks Khanmigo, ""Can you write my body paragraph for me? Can you rewrite this sentence? Can you tell me another way to say this statement or something?"" Khanmigo will not allow them, or Khanmigo will not tell
them how to write it, but it could follow up with,
""Here's what I recommend doing, or here's how I'd recommend
going about this."" Or it'll find ways to unblock
them if they're feeling stuck. And then if they're also doing things like pasting content from
outside of their outline here into their draft, we are also
doing things behind the scenes that the student isn't really aware of that will indicate that to teachers. And I will show you what that looks like when I show you the rest
of the teacher experience. But when the student is ready
to move on to revising, again, we're gonna do a behind the scenes check. Is it a complete draft, does this look like a first draft, is it aligned to what the assignment was before we let them move on to revising. And then during the revising stage, the first thing that happens is Khanmigo will generate feedback in
five general categories. These are broadly aligned
to most, you know, rubrics across different
standards frameworks. But introduction includes
things like thesis or claim alignment,
hook, context, et cetera, evidence and reasoning,
pretty straightforward, structure and organization,
conclusion, style, and tone. And so the feedback gets
generated in these five areas. Khanmigo aims to give positive feedback as well as constructive feedback. And then one of the nicest
features about Writing Coach is that it doesn't just end with the feedback and then leave the student up, leave the student to their own devices to kind of use that how they like. There are opportunities
for students to engage with Khanmigo about the
feedback that they received. So I actually don't
think you can see it here because, oh yeah, here's an example. The prompts that we give students when we give them a piece
of feedback include kind of almost like sentence starters. So in this case, the student
starts a quotation abruptly without giving the context
of where it's coming from. So the student can say,
""Give me an example."" And Khanmigo will give
them example, again, from a completely different
essay topic or prompt. If they make a change in the actual essay, the student can say, ""Check my revision"", and it will follow up with that feedback. So here's an example of
what that looks like. In this particular feedback, Khanmigo is saying
introductory information to set up your quotations. So similar to that other
feedback that you just saw. So the student said, ""Explain suggestion"", and it's giving an example
from another essay. So pollution is harmful, and then the student
just plops in a quote, which was something my seventh
graders did all the time. And then in this kind
of exemplary response, there is more context that
shows where the quote come from, comes from and sets that
up a little bit better so the student can then go
back in and make that revision and mark that feedback as resolved. And they can work their
way through this feedback, engaging with Khanmigo,
asking follow up questions, asking for re-revisions or re-reviews of the
feedback as they like. And when they're done, they
can mark it as complete and they can export the final draft to any of these three different formats. And that is in just the student experience of the Writing Coach. But if I go back to the, let me switch my screen. Hold on. Here we go. Okay, back to the teacher experience. I'm now gonna click into the assignment that that same student
was just working on. So I'm gonna click on review, which will take me to the class report. Again, this is this essay
about school start times and I am going to click on, oh, actually, let's look at this. So if I go to students who have started or completed the assignment,
I can see, at a glance, where students are in the writing process, I can see who's completed
or what step they're on, if they have not yet
completed but started, I can see if they edited their essay after the due date passed or if they haven't completed
it yet and it's past due date, I can see when they last worked on it, how much time they
spent overall across all of the four stages, the current
word count of their draft. And then in terms of the
feedback that Khanmigo gave, how much feedback they got and how much of that
feedback they resolved. Future things coming, we're
gonna show them, you know, how much time was spent on each
stage of the writing process as well as where the feedback
was kind of concentrated for those different students. And then this is one of the more exciting and interesting aspects of
Writing Coach for many teachers and administrators, which
is this originality index. So the originality flags
are what I mentioned we trigger in the backend
when a student does something like paste a certain number
of words in a certain field. And this happens either
during the outlining phase. So if the student is pasting
text into an evidence field, for obvious reasons,
that is not an a flag, we expect them to do something like that. But if they paste a large amount
of text in their main point or their thesis field,
we're gonna trigger a flag for the teacher just so they
can double click into that and figure out what exactly happened. And then for their draft
and their first draft and their kind of revised draft, again, if they're pasting from
an outline, that's fine. If they're pasting from
somewhere outside of the outline, more than a couple of words, we're gonna trigger that
flag for the teacher. And it's not about saying
definitively, you know, this student cheated or this
student probably cheated. It is really just a sign that's telling teachers what happened. So I can now click into this student, let's see what this one says. And I can see that,
you know, on this date, during the revising stage, when the student's essay looked like this, they pasted 30 words
from an unknown source. Unknown source means not their outline. And I can see in this particular case what the student pasted was
another piece of evidence. And if I click ahead just
three minutes, I can see, okay, yes, the student
added a little context, they added some end quotes,
and they added their source. So I can dismiss this
flag, this is not an issue, not a cheating concern. I can feel confident that
this student, you know, this was their work. But if I go back to another
student who has flags as well and click into this, I can see this student
actually has two flags. One of them happened during outlining, so I can see they pasted
100 words into a main point or topic section, which I see right here. I can tell as a teacher
it's very different from the main points in
the other paragraphs. I also have access to
their full chat history. So during different stages
of the writing process. So I can kind of skim that and get a sense of how the
student was engaging with the AI. This obviously kind of
affirms my suspicion that maybe the student
did not write this text, and I should follow up with them directly about
why they're asking Khanmigo to give them evidence and why they're pasting 100
words into their outline that look very different from the other parts of their outline. Again, if I click on the
second flag during drafting, I can see here again the student
is really asking Khanmigo to do the work for them. And of course, Khanmigo's declining. But I can see what happened
during this interaction, which is that the student basically pasted the entire conclusion
paragraph into their essay after, you know, working
on the first draft for about an hour. So these are the originality flags. Again, they're meant to be
indications to the teachers about what happened and when, and give the teachers more visibility into how students are writing. And I think the way I like to think about it is it's
not just about, you know, cheating or like, catching
students in these moments, but there is a lot of value too
in being able to get a sense of the student's entire writing process. This was something that
I did not have access to or, you know, the resources or the time to keep track
of when I was a teacher, but if I know, you know,
a student is struggling, if I can identify three
to five kids in each class that are clearly struggling
the most with writing, I can drill down into
their writing process and figure out, you know, is the issue that the student really
struggled with outlining and developing their ideas? Did they have a hard time coming up with vocabulary words or how to phrase things during drafting? What kinds of questions were they asking? What kinds of things were
they getting feedback on? Were they engaging with that feedback? What does their revision
process look like? It's a level of visibility
into the writing process that I think hasn't existed before. And this is different from
something like, you know, Google Docs draft history,
which really just shows me how a document changed over time. I don't just have access to
the student's drafting history or revising history. I have access to the
feedback they receive, I have access to how they
engaged with that feedback, I have access to the outline
and the thought process and the history of how
they developed their ideas, I have access to the way that their stance on something might have
evolved over the course of kind of exploring the
topic that they're asked, being asked to write about. And again, I don't think
we expect teachers to do, to go into that level of review for every single student in their class, but that's why we have these
higher level class reports to give teachers access
to this level of data, but also kind of surface insights that we think will help indicate to them, you know, where should I, as a teacher, drill down my attention into? Is it, you know, following
up about cheating concerns? Is it figuring out, you know,
this student got 21 pieces of feedback versus this
student who got 10, this student probably, you know, needs a little bit more help. Or, you know, this student might have spent a really long time, you know, what does that indicate to me? And we're giving the
autonomy to the teachers to kind of decide how
they want to drill down into how they review that kind of data. But the access is there and the high level insights are there and we're really excited too about the different ways we're thinking about surfacing instructional
insights to teachers or letting them engage with the AI themselves
about the assignments that the students are completing. But that is it for my Writing Coach, version of the Writing Coach demo. Aviv, you had asked for me to also talk a little
bit about teacher tools. - [Aviv] Yes, please, thank you. - All right. No problem. Okay. So if you've heard of
Khanmigo prior to this, you are probably familiar
with our teacher tools. Teacher tools are free
currently to all teachers across the US and any teacher can sign up and access them here. And I think, you know, again, Khan Academy is very well known for math and science content, but
a lot of our AI tools, a lot of our Khanmigo tools are actually, I think, even more geared
toward humanities teachers than, you know, they might be geared towards some math and science teachers. And some examples of these tools are for ELA teachers in particular. I'll start with the, let's see, where's discussion? Discussion Prompts. So Discussion Prompts is an AI tool that, all of these AI tools,
by the way, are meant to be teacher efficiency
tools or productivity tools. They help with resource
creation, instructional planning, developing class materials. And so in Discussion Prompts, in the Discussion Prompts case, I actually think this is
a really powerful tool for coming up with ideas for essay prompts that you could then use
in the Writing Coach tool. So the teacher can select the
grade level that they want and then the topic, you know,
maybe you are talking about, I taught ""Lord of the
Flies"" in my classroom, maybe you're talking about,
you know, chaos versus order or something along those lines. Or even you could say,
you know, chapter three of ""Lord of Flies"" and Khanmigo will suggest
different discussion prompts that you could use for a class discussion or you could convert into an actual Writing Coach essay prompt. Other tools that are really
useful, chunking text is one where the teacher can
paste in something that's, you know, a 1500 words or less. And then the teacher can
indicate if they want Khanmigo to chunk a longer text by
ideas for comprehension or a shorter text by phrases for fluency. So it's not actually changing
the content of the text, but it's breaking it down into chunks for students who may need that. If there's opportunities to kind of check for understanding at different points or to break it down by fluency
chunks, if you're doing, you know, fluency practice or read alouds. Another one or a few of
them that I would also point to are the exit ticket one, the multiple choice quiz one, and the questions generator one. This was probably, you know,
aside from writing instruction, when I think about reading instruction, the thing that took the most time for me was generating questions. And this is really useful, you know, if I'm thinking about
questions about a text that we're reading in class or questions are related
to a skill that we're kind of learning in the ELA class. So we did things like practicing, identifying different kinds
of figurative language, interpreting figurative language, different kinds of conflict, different forms of characterization. If you are a teacher looking for ways that you can generate
practice questions related to skills like that, these tools are really wonderful for that. Just having something
immediately available for teachers to interact with. And I actually think one of the things to show, let's do identifying
figurative language. Let's do that. I'll do RL.74 and then I want students to practice identifying different types of figurative language. So simile, metaphor, personification, okay, looks say seventh grade
and give me 10 questions. And I think what's particularly
cool about this tool is that it doesn't just spit
out, you know, a chat response that a teacher would copy and paste somewhere into a document. It's an interactive, we call, co-editor, that's embedded in the product. So imagine a Google Doc
that you can talk to or that you can revise
with the help of AI. So if I don't like this
question, I can highlight it and I can ask Khanmigo,
""Make changes to this, try different, talk about this."" I can also just open the chat here and ask questions about it or you know, get ideas
about how to respond or how to change things
if I wanna change things. But this has been really
popular with teachers who are looking for ways
to save time planning and developing student materials. And the last one that I wanted to highlight was our rubric generator. Obviously, rubrics are really helpful for ELA teachers when it comes to writing, grading writing assignments in particular. So this is another one that's
really valuable to teachers. Basically Khanmigo will
ask them a few questions about the assignment that they want and the expectations and standards and generate a table that
they can then print out or export to use as a rubric. There's one more before I
forget, which is Text Rewriter. I'll start by saying I think
it is incredibly important for students to read grade-level content and that giving students
instructional texts at their grade level is really important. However, there are some really
cool things that you can do as a teacher with this idea
of AI as a releveling tool. For example, if I'm
teaching a grade-level text and I know my students are
well below grade level, I might do a really interesting
instructional activity where I take a chunk of the text that might be particularly challenging and I have the AI re-level it
down a couple of grade levels and I have my students read that and I'm not having them
read that as a replacement for the grade-level content,
but I might have them read that and then give them an opportunity to read the grade-level
version and have them compare and contrast the differences, what's lost when you
re-level text with AI, how is it different in
terms of style, tone, vocabulary, diction? You know, what is present
in the original text that the AI has stripped out?
Why do you think it did that? Like, how does it change,
you know, the messaging or the theme or the tone of the piece? So I think there's really,
really interesting ways that you could use this tool
for an ELA classroom while, you know, remaining
really rigorous in the way that you were thinking about instruction. I think now I will pass it back to Aviv. - Thank you so much, Sarah. Sarah, quick interesting
question we got in the chat, there were a lot of
really great questions. One of them was specifically around this issue of plagiarism, right? So if a student is typing something in, it's not necessarily
from a well-known text, but they are copying
from a different place, so it wouldn't necessarily pick up on it as not being the student's own, right? How might the teacher get to that? - Yeah, so we aimed for the thing that we knew would be
the most effective way at getting at the way
most students are cheating at the moment first. And that is by pasting in
content outside of their outline. One of the ways we're thinking about evolving the originality flags and adding on different,
you know, functions to the originality flags are
the way the essay is drafted. That could look like, you know, how much time the student
is spending on drafting, is their alignment between
the outline that they created and the draft that they ended up with. If there's a mismatch there, that might be something to look into. Another thing we're exploring
is, you know, linear drafting where a student is sort of creating their draft one word in front of the other without really going back and inserting sentences
here or transitions here. Something that might be
indicative of not a natural way that most students draft. Obviously that gets tricky because all students are
different and we don't wanna, you know, punish kids
who might be different sort of thinkers or writers. And so we wanna make sure that whatever we build next is very fair. The main purpose again
is to tell the teacher what happened from the
perspective of the technology, not to make some sort
of definitive accusation around what the student did. So we're using the tools
that at our disposal for, that we have at our
disposal now for doing that. But we are definitely thinking
about, you know, other hacks that students might come up with. - Yeah, yeah.
- Figuring around those. But I could also add, you know, we very, very specifically did not
include the originality flags and the student experience, you know, I've worked
with students now for most of my life and I know that they will, if they can figure out how a system works, they'll find a way to work around that. So we made it teacher-facing
only so that students, you know, cannot easily pick up on what is happening in
the teacher experience. - Yeah, thank you. I'm skipping a few slides because we have a bunch
of questions in the chat about where is Writing Coach? I don't see it on my dashboard, so I wanna be really
clear about the difference between the free tools and
these enterprise tools. So if you look at the column
on the left, you know, Khan Academy's mission is to
provide a world class education to anyone anywhere. That means that our
bottom line is learning. We measure learning
really rigorously, right, so it's never dollars and we are working around the
clock to make all of our tools as free or close to free
as humanly possible. So at the moment, what we have that's free is forever all of our content. You never have to choose
when you work with us, do I focus on science or math or ELA? It's all there. It's free forever for
anyone in tons of languages. You already have access to all standards aligned
courses including all of our ELA work. Teachers can already monitor progress and growth on ELA coursework. They can assign, they can
make targeted assignments, class-wide assignments for students. And then teachers have all
of those Khanmigo tools that Sarah showed us at the end that support an ELA classroom. These are teacher-facing only. That is for a very specific reason, which is that to roll AI out
to students takes a village. We work in a triangle with
families and administration and Khan Academy around the
clock to monitor student use and we really do work shoulder to shoulder with districts to make
sure that our rollout of AI is serving the purpose of learning. If you do partner with Khan Academy, you get a dedicated
district success manager, seamless rostering,
administrator reporting, which we talked a little
bit about in the chat, PL specifically around AI. And then teachers can actually
assign Khanmigo activities to students and that is when students will actually see Khanmigo's Student Tutor and Writing Coach. And then just to double click into that, as Sarah showed you, whether students are chatting
with Khanmigo on Writing Coach or just working on some math problems, Khanmigo will use a line
of Socratic questioning to get into student
thinking on their writing or on their thinking about
a tricky math problem. And on writing, as you saw, they'll get really specific
actionable feedback where the goal is to produce
more and more writing. And then again for admins and teachers, admins get admin AI tools. We're talking data insights
that show administrators, not just are people using it or not, but also which activities are
teachers using Khanmigo for. So we're really kind of
putting together this story as the year goes on of like,
how is this district using AI to support learning,
what's working, what's not? And then the services that we touched on, like professional learning,
AI coaching, whatever it is that your district needs, whether that's on a district-wide basis or a few schools at a time. Yeah, so we'll pause here. If you do wanna chat, if this is compelling for your district, I know some of us are just here 'cause we wanted to see
what sort of the latest and greatest in AI for ELA is. But if you are interested
in chatting with a member of our team, these are the folks who are experts in bringing
this technology to schools across the US and you can reach
us by scanning this QR code. It'll take you directly
to an info request form and you can always visit us

AI for Writing: A Deep Dive for Administrators,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TonUa-uB8hY,"- Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining. We'll get started in
about a minute and a half. Thanks for being with us. If you wanna share where
you're calling in from, that would be great to see. And I would also love
to know what drew you to this seminar today. Is it specifically ELA? Is it Sarah Robertson? Would love to know what's compelling to you about this topic. Folks just joining,
thank you for being here. If you wanna drop your name in the chat, say where you're coming in from, and also share what drew you to join this conversation
today, that would be great. Okay, so I wanna be
super respectful of time, so we'll get started right away. My name is Aviv Weiss. I'm here with Sarah Robertson. I'm gonna quickly share my screen. Sarah, can you give me a thumbs
up that you see my screen? Okay, perfect. So, I'm here with Sarah Robertson. Sarah taught for 10 years
as an English teacher, has extensive experience in curriculum design and instruction. She and I actually both taught in the same public charter
network well over 10 years ago. Sarah today works on literacy
and classroom experience. You'll see more of sort of
what that work looks like, what it means today. And I've been working, since I left the classroom six years ago, I've been working at Khan Academy. I'm, like, the luckiest
person in the world. It was my first job after
leaving the classroom. And I've been working specifically on the Khan Academy Districts team. So my job has been to bring our services, so professional learning and
strategic implementation, support of Khan Academy, all the content, all the classroom tools to hundreds of school districts across the US. Let's dive right into today's topic, which is progress in the
ELA classroom now that AI is at our fingertips. So before we even talk
about what that means, what that looks like, I do wanna touch on probably the most
important piece to all of us in this room, which is safety. As a nonprofit, Sal Khan and the whole Khan Academy team, we are completely focused
on helping school districts and individual schools
drive deep student learning. AI is one more tool in the toolbox, but I do wanna just take this
opportunity to share that, whether it's Khan Academy or
any other sort of AI provider or vendor, everyone
should, at the very least, have clean SOC 2 type two audits, be FERPA and COPPA compliant, state specific or district-specific
terms of services. These are, like, table stakes things that need to be in place. So I encourage you to learn
more about what that looks like with Khan Academy, given we
have so many free AI tools and anyone else you're working with. And Sarah will show
more, in just a moment, of what moderation technology
that keeps students safe looks like in the writing
coach tool specifically. So let's dive into today's topic. Sarah and I both know, I
think probably especially 'cause we worked for the same
network for a number of years. We would run interim
assessments four times a year, which meant for English
teachers that we had 90 to 100 essays to grade at
least four times in a year. And of course, that was
just for assessments. There was lots of writing that happens throughout a regular school week, but those four times a
year would really kind of focus us on this incredible
problem of not being able to provide meaningful, timely
feedback to our students. And we would sit there
with literal piles of paper and if we were lucky, some pizza, and we knew that we had,
like, 90 minutes to grade before they couldn't keep
us in the building anymore. And then we'd give it back to the students and then maybe we would review in class and run around the classroom, like, with a chicken without its head on, like, trying to quickly
give feedback in the moment. Sarah, you have the opportunity to work on this problem in a
technology development setting. Can you talk to this group to me about how this problem made its way from your real lived life to
what you're working on now at Khan Academy? - Yeah, of course. Thanks everybody for joining. Really excited to talk about this. As Aviv mentioned, I think when we talk about ELA in particular, it is a different ball game
when it comes to the challenges that teachers are facing in classrooms. And I say this as
somebody who left teaching before ChatGPT came out. I mean, I think it starts with the fact that the expectations
are obviously very high. I don't know how well known this is, but the National Commission
on Writing actually recommends that students spend 60
minutes per day writing. This is middle and high school students. That's the recommendation. And grade level writing
standards are pretty high. I can say, you know, having
taught middle school students in Boston, many of my
students came to me well below grade level in
both reading and writing. But I think what makes
writing particularly hard is that the demand of the writing process, writing is very time consuming. And as a teacher, you know,
typically you're working with a class of 25, 30, 30-something kids in the room at a time, and then you might have multiple
sections that you teach. So, you know, I had about 100 students that I was responsible for. And knowing that I needed to
give them not just assessments that, you know, tested
their writing skills, but I needed to give them practice and I didn't just need
to give them practice, I needed to give them
feedback on that practice. That becomes almost
impossible for an ELA teacher to do at the level of 60 minutes a day if you
are giving kids feedback, and kids cannot grow without feedback. And that feedback also, it
can't just be, like, a rubric with some things circled. Like, good feedback is specific, actionable, personalized, and timely, like, delivered in a timely manner so that students can kind
of analyze what they've done and implement changes
immediately in the draft that they've already started and then in future writing as well. But we all know, I mean,
you all are well aware that this is not happening
effectively in many classrooms in the US and I think
once ChatGPT was launched, there became an entirely new challenge that English teachers in particular and humanities teachers faced, which is it becomes really difficult for a humanities teacher to
actually know what content that a student is turning in was created by them versus by AI. I know a lot of teachers who rely on things like AI detectors. Those have proven to be highly ineffective at actually figuring out
what is written by a human and what is written by AI. And so when we saw this
technology, you know, come out, I think the first reaction was, ""Oh no, this makes teaching so much harder."" But at the same time, we
saw potential for a way to solve those problems
that we hadn't had before. So as somebody who's worked
in building EdTech products for ELA teachers now
for almost eight years, I can tell you that when we
saw this technology in action, immediately we began thinking about how the game has changed
for education technology, how the challenges have changed, and how the potential has
changed for what we could build. So at Khan Academy, we saw a really big opportunity in this very specific
area of writing feedback. So we spent actually one week to start prototyping an
experience where we tested what would happen if a student
had access to an AI tool that would help them craft a thesis and not write it for them. So we experimented with this idea and what we found at the end of that week was it was
actually really powerful what we could build if we just kind of prompt engineered the AI
in the ways that we wanted to and builded a product that, and built a product that
wasn't just, you know, a chat bot on the side of a kind of classic learning experience,
but actually integrated into the learning experience for students. So I am gonna jump into the demo of what that initial prototype evolved into, because now it's been, you know, almost two years I think since we started working
on this specific problem of the ELA instruction, the writing instruction for teachers. - Perfect, and Sarah,
while you tee that up, I just wanna remind
everyone the chat is open. While Sarah's showing everything. I'll be looking at the chat and very happy to answer your questions and make sure to get them
up to Sarah afterwards. Please just write them in
the chat, if you don't mind. - All right. Aviv, are you seeing About This Activity? - [Aviv] I am.
- Okay, great. So I'm gonna start from
actually the teacher experience. The teacher experience of Writing Coach, we wanted to treat it as important as the student experience
of Writing Coach, because we still believe
that writing teachers, English teachers, humanities
teachers are going to be the drivers of this learning. We want them to maintain control of what students are writing about, when they wanna assign essays, and beyond that, we wanna
give them the flexibility to define the expectations for assignments and also giving them the
insights and the reporting and the record of what
students worked on in ways that have really never
been possible before. So I'm gonna start from
the teacher experience, just to show you what it
looks like for a teacher who is setting up a Writing
Coach essay assignment. So these are the learning
activities right now for students on Khan
Academy's Khanmigo AI Tutor and Writing Coach is right
here under the write category. So teachers, when they access this page, they see kind of a
teacher-facing informational page that gives them an overview of how Writing Coach works
from a teacher perspective. And then teachers can do things
like preview sample essays under my essays or even
start their own essay if they wanna demo the Writing
Coach experience for students or try it out themselves. My assignments is where they
manage the actual essays that they're assigning to students. So when a teacher wants to create a Writing Coach assignment, they have total control over what students are writing about. So if your teachers are working
off of a specific curriculum that already has writing prompts or they, you know, design
their own writing curriculum, they can use those writing prompts. This is not the kind of
thing where we force you to choose between the
prompts that we've designed. We really leave it up to the teacher to decide what they want to assign. You can also do, you know, find prompts from previous
state writing assessments. If you have state writing assessments, you can literally copy
and paste the essay prompt and instructions into this box. So teachers get to choose
the title of the assignment, they can select from the grade levels. Right now we officially
support grade seven through 12 for Writing Coach. It will work for younger grades, but it isn't exactly calibrated to support really low
level fifth, you know, sixth grade typical writing. I think it would just be
a little bit more advanced for those grade levels. So right now, the official
grades we support are seventh through 12th, but if
you have advanced fifth or sixth graders, there's nothing stopping
them from using this. And then for essay types,
we support the primary kind of academic middle and
high school essay format. So persuasive and argumentative essays, explanatory or expository
essays, and literary analysis. And again, the teacher can just
paste in their essay prompt and instructions here. The more specific these instructions are, the better the experience
will be for students. This is a field that
the AI itself is using to determine how it supports students. So if the teacher says, ""I want students to include a concession and rebuttal paragraph for
this argumentative essay"", that is a sign then to the AI to make sure that students include that when they are writing their
drafts or even their outlines. So the more granular it gets, the more helpful Khanmigo can be. And another example is, you
know, I want my students to use MLA or APA citations,
like, that level of detail is what will help Khanmigo recognize
what the teacher expects and ensure that students
are held to that standard. And then, of course, we have
things like minimum word count and then typical, you know, due dates and those kinds of things. And then I'll jump over
to the student experience. Let me change my window here. Okay, now I'm in a student account. So similarly, the students
have their activities page, but if they're given a
Writing Coach assignment, they'll see it, you know, in their learner homepage
under their assignments queue. But when they go to Writing Coach, they will see their
assignments listed here and they can jump right into them. So this is an example of one
that I've already completed, but Writing Coach for
students is broken down into four main stages
of the writing process. So the first stage that we've
built out is understanding, and this came from a lot
of user research we did with teachers and students,
where they were really clear that when it came to essay
assignments, one of the things that students struggled with
the most was just understanding what the teacher was expecting of them, breaking down the prompt, really figuring out what
the expectations were. Getting help with, like, the
first step of figuring out, do I need to do research? Do I need to find evidence in a text the teacher provided? Do I need to do some brainstorming? And this is where the student gets access to what the teacher assigned, and this is an exact copy of what the teacher
assigned here on the left. And then when students join, they will initially get a
prompt from Khanmigo saying, ""I'm here to help with
essay requirements."" And students can engage with, you know, two recommended chats with Khanmigo about
the essay instructions, or a student can ask
any question about it. So if the student kind of wants to dig into essay requirements, Khanmigo will summarize
them for the student, it will prompt them to figure out if they're ready to move on. So it will follow up with questions like, ""What do I do with.."" ""Well, have you done reading
or research on the topic?"" And then it's, you know, what do you think your
main claim is going to be? And reassuring them if they're confused and encouraging them to take a next step, like, organizing their thoughts, giving them ideas like
mind maps or Venn diagrams. It will react to whatever
the student is saying around whether or not
they have a position. It can define, you know, key terms in the essay
instructions, what does rebut mean, and kind of help them
to figure out, you know, when they're ready to move
on to the second stage, which is outlining. Again, this is a completed
Writing Coach assignment. So a fresh kind of new
Writing Coach assignment, a student would see this
blank essay template and the blank essay template, you know, when there isn't text in here, the student will see
an exemplar, you know, example of a thesis. Same thing for main points
and topics and evidences and examples so that students
can see an expectation of what that might look like, but align it to a completely different essay topic. So we're not gonna, you know, give them something they can copy, but we are gonna show them what, you know, an exemplary main point might look like or thesis statement might look like for that given essay type. And then again, Khanmigo is here, their assignment instructions
are always accessible in the right-hand panel. And Khanmigo will start
with the, ""I'm here."" The next step is outlining. And students can kind
of engage with Khanmigo if they want to or if they're
all set, they don't have to. So the outline is designed
to be really flexible. Students can add or
remove body paragraphs. They can add or remove different
components like evidence and source and reasoning or explanation. We want it to be the
kind of outline format that will support, you know, pretty much any essay structure. And then Khanmigo is there
if a student gets stuck. So if they're blank page,
you know, a little bit, feeling a little paralyzed by what to do, they can just say, ""I'm stuck."" Or if they make a little progress, they can ask Khanmigo to
check their outline so far. Khanmigo is gonna break it down for them if they say they're stuck. It is not going to give them any answers or it's not going to give
them any direct things to include or write. I think in this particular account I'm in, I don't have examples of
the student asking Khanmigo to cheat for them, but I can show you that from the teacher perspective and kind of how that is handled there. But you can see here, in
this case, this is kind of the perspective of a student
who asks a lot of questions. We know that there are also many students who don't ask questions,
but they still have them and they still want to, we still wanna make sure that they are getting checked in on. So another thing that we
do in Writing Coach is when a student moves from
outlining to drafting, let's say they fill out
part of their outline or you know, some of their outline and they try to move on to drafting, even if they're not
asking Khanmigo for help or if they haven't asked for help at all, we are gonna do a behind the
scenes check of that outline and look for is it aligned to
what the teacher asked for? Is it on topic? Did they write an essay, you
know, with a particular thesis but then the body paragraphs
contradict the thesis? Like, it's checking for
general completeness and then also general alignment. It's not gonna go really
deep on the details of how they've expressed their ideas, but it's gonna check for
general alignment to make sure that their outline is complete and that it is aligned to
what the teacher has asked for and the argument they're trying to make. And that will kind of
be a sort of checkpoint before they move on to the next stage. So even though students who
are really not gonna engage or take the initiative
to engage with Khanmigo, they will still have the
opportunity to be followed up with before they move on. The drafting stage is
pretty straightforward. Again, students have access to
their assignment instructions and a Khanmigo chat that's
gonna be there to help them through this particular
stage of the writing. But they also have access to
the outline that they drafted with Khanmigo in the previous stage. And when they have access to this outline, they can copy and paste
chunks of it into their draft, get an updated word count, and begin to construct that first draft. And again, when the student asks Khanmigo, ""Can you write my body paragraph for me? Can you rewrite this sentence? Can you tell me another way to say this statement or something?"" Khanmigo will not allow them, or Khanmigo will not tell
them how to write it, but it could follow up with,
""Here's what I recommend doing, or here's how I'd recommend
going about this."" Or it'll find ways to unblock
them if they're feeling stuck. And then if they're also doing things like pasting content from
outside of their outline here into their draft, we are also
doing things behind the scenes that the student isn't really aware of that will indicate that to teachers. And I will show you what that looks like when I show you the rest
of the teacher experience. But when the student is ready
to move on to revising, again, we're gonna do a behind the scenes check. Is it a complete draft, does this look like a first draft, is it aligned to what the assignment was before we let them move on to revising. And then during the revising stage, the first thing that happens is Khanmigo will generate feedback in
five general categories. These are broadly aligned
to most, you know, rubrics across different
standards frameworks. But introduction includes
things like thesis or claim alignment,
hook, context, et cetera, evidence and reasoning,
pretty straightforward, structure and organization,
conclusion, style, and tone. And so the feedback gets
generated in these five areas. Khanmigo aims to give positive feedback as well as constructive feedback. And then one of the nicest
features about Writing Coach is that it doesn't just end with the feedback and then leave the student up, leave the student to their own devices to kind of use that how they like. There are opportunities
for students to engage with Khanmigo about the
feedback that they received. So I actually don't
think you can see it here because, oh yeah, here's an example. The prompts that we give students when we give them a piece
of feedback include kind of almost like sentence starters. So in this case, the student
starts a quotation abruptly without giving the context
of where it's coming from. So the student can say,
""Give me an example."" And Khanmigo will give
them example, again, from a completely different
essay topic or prompt. If they make a change in the actual essay, the student can say, ""Check my revision"", and it will follow up with that feedback. So here's an example of
what that looks like. In this particular feedback, Khanmigo is saying
introductory information to set up your quotations. So similar to that other
feedback that you just saw. So the student said, ""Explain suggestion"", and it's giving an example
from another essay. So pollution is harmful, and then the student
just plops in a quote, which was something my seventh
graders did all the time. And then in this kind
of exemplary response, there is more context that
shows where the quote come from, comes from and sets that
up a little bit better so the student can then go
back in and make that revision and mark that feedback as resolved. And they can work their
way through this feedback, engaging with Khanmigo,
asking follow up questions, asking for re-revisions or re-reviews of the
feedback as they like. And when they're done, they
can mark it as complete and they can export the final draft to any of these three different formats. And that is in just the student experience of the Writing Coach. But if I go back to the, let me switch my screen. Hold on. Here we go. Okay, back to the teacher experience. I'm now gonna click into the assignment that that same student
was just working on. So I'm gonna click on review, which will take me to the class report. Again, this is this essay
about school start times and I am going to click on, oh, actually, let's look at this. So if I go to students who have started or completed the assignment,
I can see, at a glance, where students are in the writing process, I can see who's completed
or what step they're on, if they have not yet
completed but started, I can see if they edited their essay after the due date passed or if they haven't completed
it yet and it's past due date, I can see when they last worked on it, how much time they
spent overall across all of the four stages, the current
word count of their draft. And then in terms of the
feedback that Khanmigo gave, how much feedback they got and how much of that
feedback they resolved. Future things coming, we're
gonna show them, you know, how much time was spent on each
stage of the writing process as well as where the feedback
was kind of concentrated for those different students. And then this is one of the more exciting and interesting aspects of
Writing Coach for many teachers and administrators, which
is this originality index. So the originality flags
are what I mentioned we trigger in the backend
when a student does something like paste a certain number
of words in a certain field. And this happens either
during the outlining phase. So if the student is pasting
text into an evidence field, for obvious reasons,
that is not an a flag, we expect them to do something like that. But if they paste a large amount
of text in their main point or their thesis field,
we're gonna trigger a flag for the teacher just so they
can double click into that and figure out what exactly happened. And then for their draft
and their first draft and their kind of revised draft, again, if they're pasting from
an outline, that's fine. If they're pasting from
somewhere outside of the outline, more than a couple of words, we're gonna trigger that
flag for the teacher. And it's not about saying
definitively, you know, this student cheated or this
student probably cheated. It is really just a sign that's telling teachers what happened. So I can now click into this student, let's see what this one says. And I can see that,
you know, on this date, during the revising stage, when the student's essay looked like this, they pasted 30 words
from an unknown source. Unknown source means not their outline. And I can see in this particular case what the student pasted was
another piece of evidence. And if I click ahead just
three minutes, I can see, okay, yes, the student
added a little context, they added some end quotes,
and they added their source. So I can dismiss this
flag, this is not an issue, not a cheating concern. I can feel confident that
this student, you know, this was their work. But if I go back to another
student who has flags as well and click into this, I can see this student
actually has two flags. One of them happened during outlining, so I can see they pasted
100 words into a main point or topic section, which I see right here. I can tell as a teacher
it's very different from the main points in
the other paragraphs. I also have access to
their full chat history. So during different stages
of the writing process. So I can kind of skim that and get a sense of how the
student was engaging with the AI. This obviously kind of
affirms my suspicion that maybe the student
did not write this text, and I should follow up with them directly about
why they're asking Khanmigo to give them evidence and why they're pasting 100
words into their outline that look very different from the other parts of their outline. Again, if I click on the
second flag during drafting, I can see here again the student
is really asking Khanmigo to do the work for them. And of course, Khanmigo's declining. But I can see what happened
during this interaction, which is that the student basically pasted the entire conclusion
paragraph into their essay after, you know, working
on the first draft for about an hour. So these are the originality flags. Again, they're meant to be
indications to the teachers about what happened and when, and give the teachers more visibility into how students are writing. And I think the way I like to think about it is it's
not just about, you know, cheating or like, catching
students in these moments, but there is a lot of value too
in being able to get a sense of the student's entire writing process. This was something that
I did not have access to or, you know, the resources or the time to keep track
of when I was a teacher, but if I know, you know,
a student is struggling, if I can identify three
to five kids in each class that are clearly struggling
the most with writing, I can drill down into
their writing process and figure out, you know, is the issue that the student really
struggled with outlining and developing their ideas? Did they have a hard time coming up with vocabulary words or how to phrase things during drafting? What kinds of questions were they asking? What kinds of things were
they getting feedback on? Were they engaging with that feedback? What does their revision
process look like? It's a level of visibility
into the writing process that I think hasn't existed before. And this is different from
something like, you know, Google Docs draft history,
which really just shows me how a document changed over time. I don't just have access to
the student's drafting history or revising history. I have access to the
feedback they receive, I have access to how they
engaged with that feedback, I have access to the outline
and the thought process and the history of how
they developed their ideas, I have access to the way that their stance on something might have
evolved over the course of kind of exploring the
topic that they're asked, being asked to write about. And again, I don't think
we expect teachers to do, to go into that level of review for every single student in their class, but that's why we have these
higher level class reports to give teachers access
to this level of data, but also kind of surface insights that we think will help indicate to them, you know, where should I, as a teacher, drill down my attention into? Is it, you know, following
up about cheating concerns? Is it figuring out, you know,
this student got 21 pieces of feedback versus this
student who got 10, this student probably, you know, needs a little bit more help. Or, you know, this student might have spent a really long time, you know, what does that indicate to me? And we're giving the
autonomy to the teachers to kind of decide how
they want to drill down into how they review that kind of data. But the access is there and the high level insights are there and we're really excited too about the different ways we're thinking about surfacing instructional
insights to teachers or letting them engage with the AI themselves
about the assignments that the students are completing. But that is it for my Writing Coach, version of the Writing Coach demo. Aviv, you had asked for me to also talk a little
bit about teacher tools. - [Aviv] Yes, please, thank you. - All right. No problem. Okay. So if you've heard of
Khanmigo prior to this, you are probably familiar
with our teacher tools. Teacher tools are free
currently to all teachers across the US and any teacher can sign up and access them here. And I think, you know, again, Khan Academy is very well known for math and science content, but
a lot of our AI tools, a lot of our Khanmigo tools are actually, I think, even more geared
toward humanities teachers than, you know, they might be geared towards some math and science teachers. And some examples of these tools are for ELA teachers in particular. I'll start with the, let's see, where's discussion? Discussion Prompts. So Discussion Prompts is an AI tool that, all of these AI tools,
by the way, are meant to be teacher efficiency
tools or productivity tools. They help with resource
creation, instructional planning, developing class materials. And so in Discussion Prompts, in the Discussion Prompts case, I actually think this is
a really powerful tool for coming up with ideas for essay prompts that you could then use
in the Writing Coach tool. So the teacher can select the
grade level that they want and then the topic, you know,
maybe you are talking about, I taught ""Lord of the
Flies"" in my classroom, maybe you're talking about,
you know, chaos versus order or something along those lines. Or even you could say,
you know, chapter three of ""Lord of Flies"" and Khanmigo will suggest
different discussion prompts that you could use for a class discussion or you could convert into an actual Writing Coach essay prompt. Other tools that are really
useful, chunking text is one where the teacher can
paste in something that's, you know, a 1500 words or less. And then the teacher can
indicate if they want Khanmigo to chunk a longer text by
ideas for comprehension or a shorter text by phrases for fluency. So it's not actually changing
the content of the text, but it's breaking it down into chunks for students who may need that. If there's opportunities to kind of check for understanding at different points or to break it down by fluency
chunks, if you're doing, you know, fluency practice or read alouds. Another one or a few of
them that I would also point to are the exit ticket one, the multiple choice quiz one, and the questions generator one. This was probably, you know,
aside from writing instruction, when I think about reading instruction, the thing that took the most time for me was generating questions. And this is really useful, you know, if I'm thinking about
questions about a text that we're reading in class or questions are related
to a skill that we're kind of learning in the ELA class. So we did things like practicing, identifying different kinds
of figurative language, interpreting figurative language, different kinds of conflict, different forms of characterization. If you are a teacher looking for ways that you can generate
practice questions related to skills like that, these tools are really wonderful for that. Just having something
immediately available for teachers to interact with. And I actually think one of the things to show, let's do identifying
figurative language. Let's do that. I'll do RL.74 and then I want students to practice identifying different types of figurative language. So simile, metaphor, personification, okay, looks say seventh grade
and give me 10 questions. And I think what's particularly
cool about this tool is that it doesn't just spit
out, you know, a chat response that a teacher would copy and paste somewhere into a document. It's an interactive, we call, co-editor, that's embedded in the product. So imagine a Google Doc
that you can talk to or that you can revise
with the help of AI. So if I don't like this
question, I can highlight it and I can ask Khanmigo,
""Make changes to this, try different, talk about this."" I can also just open the chat here and ask questions about it or you know, get ideas
about how to respond or how to change things
if I wanna change things. But this has been really
popular with teachers who are looking for ways
to save time planning and developing student materials. And the last one that I wanted to highlight was our rubric generator. Obviously, rubrics are really helpful for ELA teachers when it comes to writing, grading writing assignments in particular. So this is another one that's
really valuable to teachers. Basically Khanmigo will
ask them a few questions about the assignment that they want and the expectations and standards and generate a table that
they can then print out or export to use as a rubric. There's one more before I
forget, which is Text Rewriter. I'll start by saying I think
it is incredibly important for students to read grade-level content and that giving students
instructional texts at their grade level is really important. However, there are some really
cool things that you can do as a teacher with this idea
of AI as a releveling tool. For example, if I'm
teaching a grade-level text and I know my students are
well below grade level, I might do a really interesting
instructional activity where I take a chunk of the text that might be particularly challenging and I have the AI re-level it
down a couple of grade levels and I have my students read that and I'm not having them
read that as a replacement for the grade-level content,
but I might have them read that and then give them an opportunity to read the grade-level
version and have them compare and contrast the differences, what's lost when you
re-level text with AI, how is it different in
terms of style, tone, vocabulary, diction? You know, what is present
in the original text that the AI has stripped out?
Why do you think it did that? Like, how does it change,
you know, the messaging or the theme or the tone of the piece? So I think there's really,
really interesting ways that you could use this tool
for an ELA classroom while, you know, remaining
really rigorous in the way that you were thinking about instruction. I think now I will pass it back to Aviv. - Thank you so much, Sarah. Sarah, quick interesting
question we got in the chat, there were a lot of
really great questions. One of them was specifically around this issue of plagiarism, right? So if a student is typing something in, it's not necessarily
from a well-known text, but they are copying
from a different place, so it wouldn't necessarily pick up on it as not being the student's own, right? How might the teacher get to that? - Yeah, so we aimed for the thing that we knew would be
the most effective way at getting at the way
most students are cheating at the moment first. And that is by pasting in
content outside of their outline. One of the ways we're thinking about evolving the originality flags and adding on different,
you know, functions to the originality flags are
the way the essay is drafted. That could look like, you know, how much time the student
is spending on drafting, is their alignment between
the outline that they created and the draft that they ended up with. If there's a mismatch there, that might be something to look into. Another thing we're exploring
is, you know, linear drafting where a student is sort of creating their draft one word in front of the other without really going back and inserting sentences
here or transitions here. Something that might be
indicative of not a natural way that most students draft. Obviously that gets tricky because all students are
different and we don't wanna, you know, punish kids
who might be different sort of thinkers or writers. And so we wanna make sure that whatever we build next is very fair. The main purpose again
is to tell the teacher what happened from the
perspective of the technology, not to make some sort
of definitive accusation around what the student did. So we're using the tools
that at our disposal for, that we have at our
disposal now for doing that. But we are definitely thinking
about, you know, other hacks that students might come up with. - Yeah, yeah.
- Figuring around those. But I could also add, you know, we very, very specifically did not
include the originality flags and the student experience, you know, I've worked
with students now for most of my life and I know that they will, if they can figure out how a system works, they'll find a way to work around that. So we made it teacher-facing
only so that students, you know, cannot easily pick up on what is happening in
the teacher experience. - Yeah, thank you. I'm skipping a few slides because we have a bunch
of questions in the chat about where is Writing Coach? I don't see it on my dashboard, so I wanna be really
clear about the difference between the free tools and
these enterprise tools. So if you look at the column
on the left, you know, Khan Academy's mission is to
provide a world class education to anyone anywhere. That means that our
bottom line is learning. We measure learning
really rigorously, right, so it's never dollars and we are working around the
clock to make all of our tools as free or close to free
as humanly possible. So at the moment, what we have that's free is forever all of our content. You never have to choose
when you work with us, do I focus on science or math or ELA? It's all there. It's free forever for
anyone in tons of languages. You already have access to all standards aligned
courses including all of our ELA work. Teachers can already monitor progress and growth on ELA coursework. They can assign, they can
make targeted assignments, class-wide assignments for students. And then teachers have all
of those Khanmigo tools that Sarah showed us at the end that support an ELA classroom. These are teacher-facing only. That is for a very specific reason, which is that to roll AI out
to students takes a village. We work in a triangle with
families and administration and Khan Academy around the
clock to monitor student use and we really do work shoulder to shoulder with districts to make
sure that our rollout of AI is serving the purpose of learning. If you do partner with Khan Academy, you get a dedicated
district success manager, seamless rostering,
administrator reporting, which we talked a little
bit about in the chat, PL specifically around AI. And then teachers can actually
assign Khanmigo activities to students and that is when students will actually see Khanmigo's Student Tutor and Writing Coach. And then just to double click into that, as Sarah showed you, whether students are chatting
with Khanmigo on Writing Coach or just working on some math problems, Khanmigo will use a line
of Socratic questioning to get into student
thinking on their writing or on their thinking about
a tricky math problem. And on writing, as you saw, they'll get really specific
actionable feedback where the goal is to produce
more and more writing. And then again for admins and teachers, admins get admin AI tools. We're talking data insights
that show administrators, not just are people using it or not, but also which activities are
teachers using Khanmigo for. So we're really kind of
putting together this story as the year goes on of like,
how is this district using AI to support learning,
what's working, what's not? And then the services that we touched on, like professional learning,
AI coaching, whatever it is that your district needs, whether that's on a district-wide basis or a few schools at a time. Yeah, so we'll pause here. If you do wanna chat, if this is compelling for your district, I know some of us are just here 'cause we wanted to see
what sort of the latest and greatest in AI for ELA is. But if you are interested
in chatting with a member of our team, these are the folks who are experts in bringing
this technology to schools across the US and you can reach

AI for Writing: A Deep Dive for Administrators,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TonUa-uB8hY,"- Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining. We'll get started in
about a minute and a half. Thanks for being with us. If you wanna share where
you're calling in from, that would be great to see. And I would also love
to know what drew you to this seminar today. Is it specifically ELA? Is it Sarah Robertson? Would love to know what's compelling to you about this topic. Folks just joining,
thank you for being here. If you wanna drop your name in the chat, say where you're coming in from, and also share what drew you to join this conversation
today, that would be great. Okay, so I wanna be
super respectful of time, so we'll get started right away. My name is Aviv Weiss. I'm here with Sarah Robertson. I'm gonna quickly share my screen. Sarah, can you give me a thumbs
up that you see my screen? Okay, perfect. So, I'm here with Sarah Robertson. Sarah taught for 10 years
as an English teacher, has extensive experience in curriculum design and instruction. She and I actually both taught in the same public charter
network well over 10 years ago. Sarah today works on literacy
and classroom experience. You'll see more of sort of
what that work looks like, what it means today. And I've been working, since I left the classroom six years ago, I've been working at Khan Academy. I'm, like, the luckiest
person in the world. It was my first job after
leaving the classroom. And I've been working specifically on the Khan Academy Districts team. So my job has been to bring our services, so professional learning and
strategic implementation, support of Khan Academy, all the content, all the classroom tools to hundreds of school districts across the US. Let's dive right into today's topic, which is progress in the
ELA classroom now that AI is at our fingertips. So before we even talk
about what that means, what that looks like, I do wanna touch on probably the most
important piece to all of us in this room, which is safety. As a nonprofit, Sal Khan and the whole Khan Academy team, we are completely focused
on helping school districts and individual schools
drive deep student learning. AI is one more tool in the toolbox, but I do wanna just take this
opportunity to share that, whether it's Khan Academy or
any other sort of AI provider or vendor, everyone
should, at the very least, have clean SOC 2 type two audits, be FERPA and COPPA compliant, state specific or district-specific
terms of services. These are, like, table stakes things that need to be in place. So I encourage you to learn
more about what that looks like with Khan Academy, given we
have so many free AI tools and anyone else you're working with. And Sarah will show
more, in just a moment, of what moderation technology
that keeps students safe looks like in the writing
coach tool specifically. So let's dive into today's topic. Sarah and I both know, I
think probably especially 'cause we worked for the same
network for a number of years. We would run interim
assessments four times a year, which meant for English
teachers that we had 90 to 100 essays to grade at
least four times in a year. And of course, that was
just for assessments. There was lots of writing that happens throughout a regular school week, but those four times a
year would really kind of focus us on this incredible
problem of not being able to provide meaningful, timely
feedback to our students. And we would sit there
with literal piles of paper and if we were lucky, some pizza, and we knew that we had,
like, 90 minutes to grade before they couldn't keep
us in the building anymore. And then we'd give it back to the students and then maybe we would review in class and run around the classroom, like, with a chicken without its head on, like, trying to quickly
give feedback in the moment. Sarah, you have the opportunity to work on this problem in a
technology development setting. Can you talk to this group to me about how this problem made its way from your real lived life to
what you're working on now at Khan Academy? - Yeah, of course. Thanks everybody for joining. Really excited to talk about this. As Aviv mentioned, I think when we talk about ELA in particular, it is a different ball game
when it comes to the challenges that teachers are facing in classrooms. And I say this as
somebody who left teaching before ChatGPT came out. I mean, I think it starts with the fact that the expectations
are obviously very high. I don't know how well known this is, but the National Commission
on Writing actually recommends that students spend 60
minutes per day writing. This is middle and high school students. That's the recommendation. And grade level writing
standards are pretty high. I can say, you know, having
taught middle school students in Boston, many of my
students came to me well below grade level in
both reading and writing. But I think what makes
writing particularly hard is that the demand of the writing process, writing is very time consuming. And as a teacher, you know,
typically you're working with a class of 25, 30, 30-something kids in the room at a time, and then you might have multiple
sections that you teach. So, you know, I had about 100 students that I was responsible for. And knowing that I needed to
give them not just assessments that, you know, tested
their writing skills, but I needed to give them practice and I didn't just need
to give them practice, I needed to give them
feedback on that practice. That becomes almost
impossible for an ELA teacher to do at the level of 60 minutes a day if you
are giving kids feedback, and kids cannot grow without feedback. And that feedback also, it
can't just be, like, a rubric with some things circled. Like, good feedback is specific, actionable, personalized, and timely, like, delivered in a timely manner so that students can kind
of analyze what they've done and implement changes
immediately in the draft that they've already started and then in future writing as well. But we all know, I mean,
you all are well aware that this is not happening
effectively in many classrooms in the US and I think
once ChatGPT was launched, there became an entirely new challenge that English teachers in particular and humanities teachers faced, which is it becomes really difficult for a humanities teacher to
actually know what content that a student is turning in was created by them versus by AI. I know a lot of teachers who rely on things like AI detectors. Those have proven to be highly ineffective at actually figuring out
what is written by a human and what is written by AI. And so when we saw this
technology, you know, come out, I think the first reaction was, ""Oh no, this makes teaching so much harder."" But at the same time, we
saw potential for a way to solve those problems
that we hadn't had before. So as somebody who's worked
in building EdTech products for ELA teachers now
for almost eight years, I can tell you that when we
saw this technology in action, immediately we began thinking about how the game has changed
for education technology, how the challenges have changed, and how the potential has
changed for what we could build. So at Khan Academy, we saw a really big opportunity in this very specific
area of writing feedback. So we spent actually one week to start prototyping an
experience where we tested what would happen if a student
had access to an AI tool that would help them craft a thesis and not write it for them. So we experimented with this idea and what we found at the end of that week was it was
actually really powerful what we could build if we just kind of prompt engineered the AI
in the ways that we wanted to and builded a product that, and built a product that
wasn't just, you know, a chat bot on the side of a kind of classic learning experience,
but actually integrated into the learning experience for students. So I am gonna jump into the demo of what that initial prototype evolved into, because now it's been, you know, almost two years I think since we started working
on this specific problem of the ELA instruction, the writing instruction for teachers. - Perfect, and Sarah,
while you tee that up, I just wanna remind
everyone the chat is open. While Sarah's showing everything. I'll be looking at the chat and very happy to answer your questions and make sure to get them
up to Sarah afterwards. Please just write them in
the chat, if you don't mind. - All right. Aviv, are you seeing About This Activity? - [Aviv] I am.
- Okay, great. So I'm gonna start from
actually the teacher experience. The teacher experience of Writing Coach, we wanted to treat it as important as the student experience
of Writing Coach, because we still believe
that writing teachers, English teachers, humanities
teachers are going to be the drivers of this learning. We want them to maintain control of what students are writing about, when they wanna assign essays, and beyond that, we wanna
give them the flexibility to define the expectations for assignments and also giving them the
insights and the reporting and the record of what
students worked on in ways that have really never
been possible before. So I'm gonna start from
the teacher experience, just to show you what it
looks like for a teacher who is setting up a Writing
Coach essay assignment. So these are the learning
activities right now for students on Khan
Academy's Khanmigo AI Tutor and Writing Coach is right
here under the write category. So teachers, when they access this page, they see kind of a
teacher-facing informational page that gives them an overview of how Writing Coach works
from a teacher perspective. And then teachers can do things
like preview sample essays under my essays or even
start their own essay if they wanna demo the Writing
Coach experience for students or try it out themselves. My assignments is where they
manage the actual essays that they're assigning to students. So when a teacher wants to create a Writing Coach assignment, they have total control over what students are writing about. So if your teachers are working
off of a specific curriculum that already has writing prompts or they, you know, design
their own writing curriculum, they can use those writing prompts. This is not the kind of
thing where we force you to choose between the
prompts that we've designed. We really leave it up to the teacher to decide what they want to assign. You can also do, you know, find prompts from previous
state writing assessments. If you have state writing assessments, you can literally copy
and paste the essay prompt and instructions into this box. So teachers get to choose
the title of the assignment, they can select from the grade levels. Right now we officially
support grade seven through 12 for Writing Coach. It will work for younger grades, but it isn't exactly calibrated to support really low
level fifth, you know, sixth grade typical writing. I think it would just be
a little bit more advanced for those grade levels. So right now, the official
grades we support are seventh through 12th, but if
you have advanced fifth or sixth graders, there's nothing stopping
them from using this. And then for essay types,
we support the primary kind of academic middle and
high school essay format. So persuasive and argumentative essays, explanatory or expository
essays, and literary analysis. And again, the teacher can just
paste in their essay prompt and instructions here. The more specific these instructions are, the better the experience
will be for students. This is a field that
the AI itself is using to determine how it supports students. So if the teacher says, ""I want students to include a concession and rebuttal paragraph for
this argumentative essay"", that is a sign then to the AI to make sure that students include that when they are writing their
drafts or even their outlines. So the more granular it gets, the more helpful Khanmigo can be. And another example is, you
know, I want my students to use MLA or APA citations,
like, that level of detail is what will help Khanmigo recognize
what the teacher expects and ensure that students
are held to that standard. And then, of course, we have
things like minimum word count and then typical, you know, due dates and those kinds of things. And then I'll jump over
to the student experience. Let me change my window here. Okay, now I'm in a student account. So similarly, the students
have their activities page, but if they're given a
Writing Coach assignment, they'll see it, you know, in their learner homepage
under their assignments queue. But when they go to Writing Coach, they will see their
assignments listed here and they can jump right into them. So this is an example of one
that I've already completed, but Writing Coach for
students is broken down into four main stages
of the writing process. So the first stage that we've
built out is understanding, and this came from a lot
of user research we did with teachers and students,
where they were really clear that when it came to essay
assignments, one of the things that students struggled with
the most was just understanding what the teacher was expecting of them, breaking down the prompt, really figuring out what
the expectations were. Getting help with, like, the
first step of figuring out, do I need to do research? Do I need to find evidence in a text the teacher provided? Do I need to do some brainstorming? And this is where the student gets access to what the teacher assigned, and this is an exact copy of what the teacher
assigned here on the left. And then when students join, they will initially get a
prompt from Khanmigo saying, ""I'm here to help with
essay requirements."" And students can engage with, you know, two recommended chats with Khanmigo about
the essay instructions, or a student can ask
any question about it. So if the student kind of wants to dig into essay requirements, Khanmigo will summarize
them for the student, it will prompt them to figure out if they're ready to move on. So it will follow up with questions like, ""What do I do with.."" ""Well, have you done reading
or research on the topic?"" And then it's, you know, what do you think your
main claim is going to be? And reassuring them if they're confused and encouraging them to take a next step, like, organizing their thoughts, giving them ideas like
mind maps or Venn diagrams. It will react to whatever
the student is saying around whether or not
they have a position. It can define, you know, key terms in the essay
instructions, what does rebut mean, and kind of help them
to figure out, you know, when they're ready to move
on to the second stage, which is outlining. Again, this is a completed
Writing Coach assignment. So a fresh kind of new
Writing Coach assignment, a student would see this
blank essay template and the blank essay template, you know, when there isn't text in here, the student will see
an exemplar, you know, example of a thesis. Same thing for main points
and topics and evidences and examples so that students
can see an expectation of what that might look like, but align it to a completely different essay topic. So we're not gonna, you know, give them something they can copy, but we are gonna show them what, you know, an exemplary main point might look like or thesis statement might look like for that given essay type. And then again, Khanmigo is here, their assignment instructions
are always accessible in the right-hand panel. And Khanmigo will start
with the, ""I'm here."" The next step is outlining. And students can kind
of engage with Khanmigo if they want to or if they're
all set, they don't have to. So the outline is designed
to be really flexible. Students can add or
remove body paragraphs. They can add or remove different
components like evidence and source and reasoning or explanation. We want it to be the
kind of outline format that will support, you know, pretty much any essay structure. And then Khanmigo is there
if a student gets stuck. So if they're blank page,
you know, a little bit, feeling a little paralyzed by what to do, they can just say, ""I'm stuck."" Or if they make a little progress, they can ask Khanmigo to
check their outline so far. Khanmigo is gonna break it down for them if they say they're stuck. It is not going to give them any answers or it's not going to give
them any direct things to include or write. I think in this particular account I'm in, I don't have examples of
the student asking Khanmigo to cheat for them, but I can show you that from the teacher perspective and kind of how that is handled there. But you can see here, in
this case, this is kind of the perspective of a student
who asks a lot of questions. We know that there are also many students who don't ask questions,
but they still have them and they still want to, we still wanna make sure that they are getting checked in on. So another thing that we
do in Writing Coach is when a student moves from
outlining to drafting, let's say they fill out
part of their outline or you know, some of their outline and they try to move on to drafting, even if they're not
asking Khanmigo for help or if they haven't asked for help at all, we are gonna do a behind the
scenes check of that outline and look for is it aligned to
what the teacher asked for? Is it on topic? Did they write an essay, you
know, with a particular thesis but then the body paragraphs
contradict the thesis? Like, it's checking for
general completeness and then also general alignment. It's not gonna go really
deep on the details of how they've expressed their ideas, but it's gonna check for
general alignment to make sure that their outline is complete and that it is aligned to
what the teacher has asked for and the argument they're trying to make. And that will kind of
be a sort of checkpoint before they move on to the next stage. So even though students who
are really not gonna engage or take the initiative
to engage with Khanmigo, they will still have the
opportunity to be followed up with before they move on. The drafting stage is
pretty straightforward. Again, students have access to
their assignment instructions and a Khanmigo chat that's
gonna be there to help them through this particular
stage of the writing. But they also have access to
the outline that they drafted with Khanmigo in the previous stage. And when they have access to this outline, they can copy and paste
chunks of it into their draft, get an updated word count, and begin to construct that first draft. And again, when the student asks Khanmigo, ""Can you write my body paragraph for me? Can you rewrite this sentence? Can you tell me another way to say this statement or something?"" Khanmigo will not allow them, or Khanmigo will not tell
them how to write it, but it could follow up with,
""Here's what I recommend doing, or here's how I'd recommend
going about this."" Or it'll find ways to unblock
them if they're feeling stuck. And then if they're also doing things like pasting content from
outside of their outline here into their draft, we are also
doing things behind the scenes that the student isn't really aware of that will indicate that to teachers. And I will show you what that looks like when I show you the rest
of the teacher experience. But when the student is ready
to move on to revising, again, we're gonna do a behind the scenes check. Is it a complete draft, does this look like a first draft, is it aligned to what the assignment was before we let them move on to revising. And then during the revising stage, the first thing that happens is Khanmigo will generate feedback in
five general categories. These are broadly aligned
to most, you know, rubrics across different
standards frameworks. But introduction includes
things like thesis or claim alignment,
hook, context, et cetera, evidence and reasoning,
pretty straightforward, structure and organization,
conclusion, style, and tone. And so the feedback gets
generated in these five areas. Khanmigo aims to give positive feedback as well as constructive feedback. And then one of the nicest
features about Writing Coach is that it doesn't just end with the feedback and then leave the student up, leave the student to their own devices to kind of use that how they like. There are opportunities
for students to engage with Khanmigo about the
feedback that they received. So I actually don't
think you can see it here because, oh yeah, here's an example. The prompts that we give students when we give them a piece
of feedback include kind of almost like sentence starters. So in this case, the student
starts a quotation abruptly without giving the context
of where it's coming from. So the student can say,
""Give me an example."" And Khanmigo will give
them example, again, from a completely different
essay topic or prompt. If they make a change in the actual essay, the student can say, ""Check my revision"", and it will follow up with that feedback. So here's an example of
what that looks like. In this particular feedback, Khanmigo is saying
introductory information to set up your quotations. So similar to that other
feedback that you just saw. So the student said, ""Explain suggestion"", and it's giving an example
from another essay. So pollution is harmful, and then the student
just plops in a quote, which was something my seventh
graders did all the time. And then in this kind
of exemplary response, there is more context that
shows where the quote come from, comes from and sets that
up a little bit better so the student can then go
back in and make that revision and mark that feedback as resolved. And they can work their
way through this feedback, engaging with Khanmigo,
asking follow up questions, asking for re-revisions or re-reviews of the
feedback as they like. And when they're done, they
can mark it as complete and they can export the final draft to any of these three different formats. And that is in just the student experience of the Writing Coach. But if I go back to the, let me switch my screen. Hold on. Here we go. Okay, back to the teacher experience. I'm now gonna click into the assignment that that same student
was just working on. So I'm gonna click on review, which will take me to the class report. Again, this is this essay
about school start times and I am going to click on, oh, actually, let's look at this. So if I go to students who have started or completed the assignment,
I can see, at a glance, where students are in the writing process, I can see who's completed
or what step they're on, if they have not yet
completed but started, I can see if they edited their essay after the due date passed or if they haven't completed
it yet and it's past due date, I can see when they last worked on it, how much time they
spent overall across all of the four stages, the current
word count of their draft. And then in terms of the
feedback that Khanmigo gave, how much feedback they got and how much of that
feedback they resolved. Future things coming, we're
gonna show them, you know, how much time was spent on each
stage of the writing process as well as where the feedback
was kind of concentrated for those different students. And then this is one of the more exciting and interesting aspects of
Writing Coach for many teachers and administrators, which
is this originality index. So the originality flags
are what I mentioned we trigger in the backend
when a student does something like paste a certain number
of words in a certain field. And this happens either
during the outlining phase. So if the student is pasting
text into an evidence field, for obvious reasons,
that is not an a flag, we expect them to do something like that. But if they paste a large amount
of text in their main point or their thesis field,
we're gonna trigger a flag for the teacher just so they
can double click into that and figure out what exactly happened. And then for their draft
and their first draft and their kind of revised draft, again, if they're pasting from
an outline, that's fine. If they're pasting from
somewhere outside of the outline, more than a couple of words, we're gonna trigger that
flag for the teacher. And it's not about saying
definitively, you know, this student cheated or this
student probably cheated. It is really just a sign that's telling teachers what happened. So I can now click into this student, let's see what this one says. And I can see that,
you know, on this date, during the revising stage, when the student's essay looked like this, they pasted 30 words
from an unknown source. Unknown source means not their outline. And I can see in this particular case what the student pasted was
another piece of evidence. And if I click ahead just
three minutes, I can see, okay, yes, the student
added a little context, they added some end quotes,
and they added their source. So I can dismiss this
flag, this is not an issue, not a cheating concern. I can feel confident that
this student, you know, this was their work. But if I go back to another
student who has flags as well and click into this, I can see this student
actually has two flags. One of them happened during outlining, so I can see they pasted
100 words into a main point or topic section, which I see right here. I can tell as a teacher
it's very different from the main points in
the other paragraphs. I also have access to
their full chat history. So during different stages
of the writing process. So I can kind of skim that and get a sense of how the
student was engaging with the AI. This obviously kind of
affirms my suspicion that maybe the student
did not write this text, and I should follow up with them directly about
why they're asking Khanmigo to give them evidence and why they're pasting 100
words into their outline that look very different from the other parts of their outline. Again, if I click on the
second flag during drafting, I can see here again the student
is really asking Khanmigo to do the work for them. And of course, Khanmigo's declining. But I can see what happened
during this interaction, which is that the student basically pasted the entire conclusion
paragraph into their essay after, you know, working
on the first draft for about an hour. So these are the originality flags. Again, they're meant to be
indications to the teachers about what happened and when, and give the teachers more visibility into how students are writing. And I think the way I like to think about it is it's
not just about, you know, cheating or like, catching
students in these moments, but there is a lot of value too
in being able to get a sense of the student's entire writing process. This was something that
I did not have access to or, you know, the resources or the time to keep track
of when I was a teacher, but if I know, you know,
a student is struggling, if I can identify three
to five kids in each class that are clearly struggling
the most with writing, I can drill down into
their writing process and figure out, you know, is the issue that the student really
struggled with outlining and developing their ideas? Did they have a hard time coming up with vocabulary words or how to phrase things during drafting? What kinds of questions were they asking? What kinds of things were
they getting feedback on? Were they engaging with that feedback? What does their revision
process look like? It's a level of visibility
into the writing process that I think hasn't existed before. And this is different from
something like, you know, Google Docs draft history,
which really just shows me how a document changed over time. I don't just have access to
the student's drafting history or revising history. I have access to the
feedback they receive, I have access to how they
engaged with that feedback, I have access to the outline
and the thought process and the history of how
they developed their ideas, I have access to the way that their stance on something might have
evolved over the course of kind of exploring the
topic that they're asked, being asked to write about. And again, I don't think
we expect teachers to do, to go into that level of review for every single student in their class, but that's why we have these
higher level class reports to give teachers access
to this level of data, but also kind of surface insights that we think will help indicate to them, you know, where should I, as a teacher, drill down my attention into? Is it, you know, following
up about cheating concerns? Is it figuring out, you know,
this student got 21 pieces of feedback versus this
student who got 10, this student probably, you know, needs a little bit more help. Or, you know, this student might have spent a really long time, you know, what does that indicate to me? And we're giving the
autonomy to the teachers to kind of decide how
they want to drill down into how they review that kind of data. But the access is there and the high level insights are there and we're really excited too about the different ways we're thinking about surfacing instructional
insights to teachers or letting them engage with the AI themselves
about the assignments that the students are completing. But that is it for my Writing Coach, version of the Writing Coach demo. Aviv, you had asked for me to also talk a little
bit about teacher tools. - [Aviv] Yes, please, thank you. - All right. No problem. Okay. So if you've heard of
Khanmigo prior to this, you are probably familiar
with our teacher tools. Teacher tools are free
currently to all teachers across the US and any teacher can sign up and access them here. And I think, you know, again, Khan Academy is very well known for math and science content, but
a lot of our AI tools, a lot of our Khanmigo tools are actually, I think, even more geared
toward humanities teachers than, you know, they might be geared towards some math and science teachers. And some examples of these tools are for ELA teachers in particular. I'll start with the, let's see, where's discussion? Discussion Prompts. So Discussion Prompts is an AI tool that, all of these AI tools,
by the way, are meant to be teacher efficiency
tools or productivity tools. They help with resource
creation, instructional planning, developing class materials. And so in Discussion Prompts, in the Discussion Prompts case, I actually think this is
a really powerful tool for coming up with ideas for essay prompts that you could then use
in the Writing Coach tool. So the teacher can select the
grade level that they want and then the topic, you know,
maybe you are talking about, I taught ""Lord of the
Flies"" in my classroom, maybe you're talking about,
you know, chaos versus order or something along those lines. Or even you could say,
you know, chapter three of ""Lord of Flies"" and Khanmigo will suggest
different discussion prompts that you could use for a class discussion or you could convert into an actual Writing Coach essay prompt. Other tools that are really
useful, chunking text is one where the teacher can
paste in something that's, you know, a 1500 words or less. And then the teacher can
indicate if they want Khanmigo to chunk a longer text by
ideas for comprehension or a shorter text by phrases for fluency. So it's not actually changing
the content of the text, but it's breaking it down into chunks for students who may need that. If there's opportunities to kind of check for understanding at different points or to break it down by fluency
chunks, if you're doing, you know, fluency practice or read alouds. Another one or a few of
them that I would also point to are the exit ticket one, the multiple choice quiz one, and the questions generator one. This was probably, you know,
aside from writing instruction, when I think about reading instruction, the thing that took the most time for me was generating questions. And this is really useful, you know, if I'm thinking about
questions about a text that we're reading in class or questions are related
to a skill that we're kind of learning in the ELA class. So we did things like practicing, identifying different kinds
of figurative language, interpreting figurative language, different kinds of conflict, different forms of characterization. If you are a teacher looking for ways that you can generate
practice questions related to skills like that, these tools are really wonderful for that. Just having something
immediately available for teachers to interact with. And I actually think one of the things to show, let's do identifying
figurative language. Let's do that. I'll do RL.74 and then I want students to practice identifying different types of figurative language. So simile, metaphor, personification, okay, looks say seventh grade
and give me 10 questions. And I think what's particularly
cool about this tool is that it doesn't just spit
out, you know, a chat response that a teacher would copy and paste somewhere into a document. It's an interactive, we call, co-editor, that's embedded in the product. So imagine a Google Doc
that you can talk to or that you can revise
with the help of AI. So if I don't like this
question, I can highlight it and I can ask Khanmigo,
""Make changes to this, try different, talk about this."" I can also just open the chat here and ask questions about it or you know, get ideas
about how to respond or how to change things
if I wanna change things. But this has been really
popular with teachers who are looking for ways
to save time planning and developing student materials. And the last one that I wanted to highlight was our rubric generator. Obviously, rubrics are really helpful for ELA teachers when it comes to writing, grading writing assignments in particular. So this is another one that's
really valuable to teachers. Basically Khanmigo will
ask them a few questions about the assignment that they want and the expectations and standards and generate a table that
they can then print out or export to use as a rubric. There's one more before I
forget, which is Text Rewriter. I'll start by saying I think
it is incredibly important for students to read grade-level content and that giving students
instructional texts at their grade level is really important. However, there are some really
cool things that you can do as a teacher with this idea
of AI as a releveling tool. For example, if I'm
teaching a grade-level text and I know my students are
well below grade level, I might do a really interesting
instructional activity where I take a chunk of the text that might be particularly challenging and I have the AI re-level it
down a couple of grade levels and I have my students read that and I'm not having them
read that as a replacement for the grade-level content,
but I might have them read that and then give them an opportunity to read the grade-level
version and have them compare and contrast the differences, what's lost when you
re-level text with AI, how is it different in
terms of style, tone, vocabulary, diction? You know, what is present
in the original text that the AI has stripped out?
Why do you think it did that? Like, how does it change,
you know, the messaging or the theme or the tone of the piece? So I think there's really,
really interesting ways that you could use this tool
for an ELA classroom while, you know, remaining
really rigorous in the way that you were thinking about instruction. I think now I will pass it back to Aviv. - Thank you so much, Sarah. Sarah, quick interesting
question we got in the chat, there were a lot of
really great questions. One of them was specifically around this issue of plagiarism, right? So if a student is typing something in, it's not necessarily
from a well-known text, but they are copying
from a different place, so it wouldn't necessarily pick up on it as not being the student's own, right? How might the teacher get to that? - Yeah, so we aimed for the thing that we knew would be
the most effective way at getting at the way
most students are cheating at the moment first. And that is by pasting in
content outside of their outline. One of the ways we're thinking about evolving the originality flags and adding on different,
you know, functions to the originality flags are
the way the essay is drafted. That could look like, you know, how much time the student
is spending on drafting, is their alignment between
the outline that they created and the draft that they ended up with. If there's a mismatch there, that might be something to look into. Another thing we're exploring
is, you know, linear drafting where a student is sort of creating their draft one word in front of the other without really going back and inserting sentences
here or transitions here. Something that might be
indicative of not a natural way that most students draft. Obviously that gets tricky because all students are
different and we don't wanna, you know, punish kids
who might be different sort of thinkers or writers. And so we wanna make sure that whatever we build next is very fair. The main purpose again
is to tell the teacher what happened from the
perspective of the technology, not to make some sort
of definitive accusation around what the student did. So we're using the tools
that at our disposal for, that we have at our
disposal now for doing that. But we are definitely thinking
about, you know, other hacks that students might come up with. - Yeah, yeah.
- Figuring around those. But I could also add, you know, we very, very specifically did not
include the originality flags and the student experience, you know, I've worked
with students now for most of my life and I know that they will, if they can figure out how a system works, they'll find a way to work around that. So we made it teacher-facing
only so that students, you know, cannot easily pick up on what is happening in
the teacher experience. - Yeah, thank you. I'm skipping a few slides because we have a bunch
of questions in the chat about where is Writing Coach? I don't see it on my dashboard, so I wanna be really
clear about the difference between the free tools and
these enterprise tools. So if you look at the column
on the left, you know, Khan Academy's mission is to
provide a world class education to anyone anywhere. That means that our
bottom line is learning. We measure learning
really rigorously, right, so it's never dollars and we are working around the
clock to make all of our tools as free or close to free
as humanly possible. So at the moment, what we have that's free is forever all of our content. You never have to choose
when you work with us, do I focus on science or math or ELA? It's all there. It's free forever for
anyone in tons of languages. You already have access to all standards aligned
courses including all of our ELA work. Teachers can already monitor progress and growth on ELA coursework. They can assign, they can
make targeted assignments, class-wide assignments for students. And then teachers have all
of those Khanmigo tools that Sarah showed us at the end that support an ELA classroom. These are teacher-facing only. That is for a very specific reason, which is that to roll AI out
to students takes a village. We work in a triangle with
families and administration and Khan Academy around the
clock to monitor student use and we really do work shoulder to shoulder with districts to make
sure that our rollout of AI is serving the purpose of learning. If you do partner with Khan Academy, you get a dedicated
district success manager, seamless rostering,
administrator reporting, which we talked a little
bit about in the chat, PL specifically around AI. And then teachers can actually
assign Khanmigo activities to students and that is when students will actually see Khanmigo's Student Tutor and Writing Coach. And then just to double click into that, as Sarah showed you, whether students are chatting
with Khanmigo on Writing Coach or just working on some math problems, Khanmigo will use a line
of Socratic questioning to get into student
thinking on their writing or on their thinking about
a tricky math problem. And on writing, as you saw, they'll get really specific
actionable feedback where the goal is to produce
more and more writing. And then again for admins and teachers, admins get admin AI tools. We're talking data insights
that show administrators, not just are people using it or not, but also which activities are
teachers using Khanmigo for. So we're really kind of
putting together this story as the year goes on of like,
how is this district using AI to support learning,
what's working, what's not? And then the services that we touched on, like professional learning,
AI coaching, whatever it is that your district needs, whether that's on a district-wide basis or a few schools at a time. Yeah, so we'll pause here. If you do wanna chat, if this is compelling for your district, I know some of us are just here 'cause we wanted to see
what sort of the latest and greatest in AI for ELA is. But if you are interested
in chatting with a member of our team, these are the folks who are experts in bringing
this technology to schools across the US and you can reach
us by scanning this QR code. It'll take you directly
to an info request form and you can always visit us

will get the recording. You can feel free to share

Program design: Nim game | Intro to CS - Python | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWSs4TKs0hg,"- [Instructor] Let's design a
program with multiple files. We wanna build a basic version
of the strategy game Nim. In Nim, players take turns removing either one or
two stones from a pile. Whoever removes the last stone loses. In the version we're building, we want the user to play
against a computer player. That means we'll probably want a function that decides how many
stones the user picks up and a function that decides how many stones the computer picks up. Let's start by creating a new module for our game components to live in. I think I'm gonna name this stones.py because, at the very least, I know I'm gonna have some
functions for picking stones. I'll name one pick for user and
the other pick for computer. I don't wanna get too stuck
on this detail right now, so I'm gonna have the
computer always pick one stone and I'll figure out a
better algorithm later. The user, on the other hand, needs to pick their number
of stones via input prompt. So in pick_for_user, I'll
call the input function and then I'll return
out the number of stones that the user entered. However, we wanna make sure that this function can only
ever return one or two, so we can use a loop to
validate the user's input. If they don't enter one or
two, we repeat the prompt. Now that we have a couple
functions sketched out, let's switch over to thinking
about the main game logic. So I'll jump to the main.py file. The game continues with
players picking stones until the pile runs out, which kinda sounds like a while loop. While there are still stones, play a turn. So like with all while loops, we'll initialize our pile before the loop. In the loop condition, we'll check if the pile
is greater than zero. And then inside the loop
body, we need to update pile. So we'll call pick_for_user and subtract that number of stones. We defined pick_for_user
in the stones module. So in order to call the function, we'll need to import stones and then prefix the function name. Okay, let's pause and
test that our loop works. Because there are 10 stones, if I pick up two every time, the loop should terminate
after five iterations. Now let's add in the
computer player's turn. Just like the user, the computer will pick a number of stones and remove those from the pile. But we can't just put
this in the loop body after the user's turn, because what if the user has
already picked the last stone? A computer shouldn't get another turn 'cause the game's already over. Instead, we wanna alternate players on each iteration of the loop. So we'll add a new variable to keep track of who's turn it is. Since there are only two possible states, we can make this a Boolean. If it's true, we play the user's turn. And if it's false, we
play the computer's turn. Then at the bottom of the loop, we just swap it to the other player. If it's true, we change it to false. And if it's false, we change it to true. Okay, let's try this out. It seems like we have a pretty
good working prototype here. So now it's time to jazz
up the user interface. First, I think it would be nice if the program told us who won. We know the game is over
after the loop has terminated, so we'll print out the result here. Whoever went last must
have picked the last stone, but we already swapped over the turn at the bottom of the loop. So if it says it's the user's turn, then the computer picked the last stone. And to make it clear that you don't wanna pick the last stone, I'll print out the rules
at the top of the program. It might also be nice to
draw the pile of stones. I'll define a new function for that so I can change up how the pile looks without having to touch my main logic. The function will take in a
number of stones as a parameter and return out a picture. Let's maybe draw a little
circle for every stone. Then back in main.py, I can just call show and
print out its result. These circles look cool, but they're a little annoying to count. So I'll go back to the show function and include a number in the picture. Now let's play test. We'll run through the program a few times and see if anything feels off. Hmm, the strategy isn't
really all that interesting. If the game always starts with
the same number of stones, I would just do the same thing every time. So let's randomize that pile
size with a new function. That's much better, but it's
still not that interesting 'cause it's pretty obvious that the computer is
always picking one stone. At the very least, it can
randomly return one or two, but we wanna make it a
bit smarter than that. So it should take the number of remaining
stones into account. If there's one stone remaining, then the computer has no
choice but to pick one. If there are two stones remaining, its best option is to pick one stone so it leaves the opponent
with the last stone. Similarly, if there are three
stones, it should pick two. But what if there are four stones? It seems like no matter what you pick, you're kind of in a bad position because if you pick two, then
your opponent can pick one and leave you with the last stone. But if you pick one, your
opponent can pick two and still leave you with the last stone. This gives us some interesting insight. If the computer can leave its
opponent with four stones, then it's won the game. So if the computer has
five stones remaining, it should pick one to leave
the opponent with four stones. And if it has six stones
remaining, it should pick two. Two also leave the
opponent with four stones. Okay, let's implement the
algorithm that we have so far. If we have one, two, or five
stones, we wanna pick one. And if we have three or six
stones, we wanna pick two. Otherwise, by default, the
computer will just pick randomly. Let's test real quick
that all those cases work. Back in main.py, I'll call pick_for_computer
with a few different arguments just to make sure I get back
the return values I expect. The computer seems to be
a worthy opponent now, but there's still room to
optimize the computer's algorithm. What's its best move if the pile has eight stones or nine? I'll leave that as an
exercise for the viewer. And there's a pattern if
you map out more numbers.",Creating Modules for Game Components,"The code creates two functions for picking stones, one for the user and one for the computer.",00:00:00 - 00:05:00,2024-11-12T21:16:44Z,6784,90,1

Creating modules | Intro to CS - Python | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwe6c-wIE10,"- [Instructor] We've been writing our code all in a single file, but as our programs get
longer, our main logic tends to get buried underneath all of our
function definitions, which can make the program hard to read. So, easy solution, what if we just took all
those function definitions and move them somewhere else? That means organizing
our code into modules. To create a module, we just make a new file
with a .py file extension. File extensions tell the computer how to interpret the file's contents, like MP4 is a video,
and .py is Python code. We'll name this file arcade.py, because it's meant to contain functionality
for an arcade game. And then, we'll just move all those function definitions in here. If I run the program
now, I get a name error, because the computer doesn't know where to find those functions anymore. It may seem obvious to us that there's another file over here, but the computer doesn't
put two and two together. It only does exactly
what we tell it to do. So, if we want the computer to be aware of the arcade module when it runs the program,
we need to import it. Anytime we call one of
its functions here then, we need to prefix it with the module name. All right. That concept
is pretty straightforward. We just have our code
in multiple files now. But let's unpack how
exactly this all works. Even though our program logic may be spread across multiple
files, when we run a program, we can only ever specify
a single file to execute. We call this the entry
point or main logic. By convention in Python,
we name this file main.py. You may have noticed that
in the Khan Academy IDE, the default file is always named main.py. When we press the Run button, this is the file that executes. We can build up a program by having a function in one module call a function in another module, which imports another
module and so on and so on. But for any code to be executed, it needs to be triggered somewhere along the chain
from that entry point file. Okay. What about this import statement? How exactly does that work? When the computer executes
an import statement, it jumps execution to
the specified module. When it's done there, it'll jump execution back to the importing module and pick up from where it left off. From the computer's perspective, importing a module is effectively the same as copying and pasting all
the contents of that file where the import statement appears. But there's one key difference, the scope. Function and variable names are scope to the module
that they're defined in. This just basically adds another layer. So, in the computer's memory, all those function names are
filed under the module name. That's why if we call get_score in main.py without the arcade in front
of it, we get a name error, because the computer can't find that name
in main's global scope. By putting the arcade in front of it, we make it a two-step lookup. First, the computer looks in its memory for the arcade namespace. And then, in that scope,
it looks get_score. Module scope means that as a programmer, I don't have to worry about
what other programmers or myself yesterday are naming their functions in other files. We can both name our functions get_score, because they'll exist in different scopes. Note that we typically only
put function definitions inside a module, because the
net effect of executing that is just that the computer
has learned some new tasks. If I add a print statement
indented at the top level of this file, it executes
anytime I import this module. If that module imports another module, imports another module, and all of them have these
top level print statements, it becomes very difficult to trace where that output is coming from. So, why use modules? Well, they're really just a
convenience for the programmer. We break down our tasks into functions, and then we group those
functions into modules. Well-written modules make
programs easy to navigate, because if I want a piece of functionality related to inventory management, I would know to look in
the inventory module. They also make code more reusable, because I can package a bunch of related functionality into a module, and then import it in multiple places. And they let us focus on one thing at a
time as we're building. When I'm working in main.py, I can think about my
program at a high level and just work on how all
the pieces fit together. And when I'm working in inventory.py, I can forget about all that and just focus on the details of how inventory management works.",Code Organization in Modules,"Modules allow for organizing code in separate files, improving readability and separating functionality.",00:00:00 - 00:03:00,2024-11-09T01:07:22Z,8877,160,11

Volume of rectangular pyramids using cubes | Grade 7 (TX TEKS) | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDNCy8dalPY,"- [Speaker] We'll be exploring the volumes of rectangular pyramids today with cubes and rectangular prisms. This is a cube. All the sides are the same length. To find the volume of a cube, I can multiply the length
by the width, by the height. For example, if the
length of the cube is five and all sides are the same,
then define the volume, I would do five times five times five equals 125 centimeters cubed. I can break this prism into
three rectangular pyramids that are all congruent. So now we have a cube
that's actually made out of three rectangular pyramids, and we can see here that all of the rectangular
pyramids are congruent. The base of each rectangular
pyramid is a square. The square is the same size
as one face of our cube, and they all have the same height. Since all of these rectangular
pyramids are congruent, they all have the same volume. To summarize so far, three congruent pyramids can form a cube, and the volume of one of the pyramids will be one third of the
volume of the entire cube. This is true for all cubes, but what about other rectangular prisms where the sides have different lengths?",Volume of Rectangular Pyramids,Rectangular pyramids can be formed by dividing a cube into three congruent parts.,00:00:00 - 00:04:00,2024-11-06T18:28:04Z,4873,91,1

Volume of rectangular pyramids using rectangular prisms | Grade 7 (TX TEKS) | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPey8fjuH84,"- [Instructor] Now, let's
look at a rectangular prism. This is not a cube because we can see that all the sides have different lengths. We have the length and
the width and the height, and those are all different. To find the volume of this, I would still multiply
the length by the width, by the height, but those would
all be different lengths. Just like we did with our cube, we can also break a rectangular prism into three rectangular pyramids. We know that for a cube, the
three pyramids are congruent. But when I take these apart, these definitely don't
look congruent to me. If I compare each of them
to my rectangular prism, I can see that they are all different. For example, for my pink pyramid, these bases are the same and the height corresponds
to the other length. Now, let's take a look at this yellow one. So now, this, the base,
the rectangular base, corresponds to this side, and the height here
corresponds to that side. Now, for my green one, this
base corresponds to this face while the height
corresponds to this height. And so we can see here that
all three of the pyramids do look different, but
let's compare their volumes. So how do you think we might figure out if the volumes of these
pyramids are the same, or how they might compare with each other? Well, a simple method is to
fill them up with something and actually compare which holds more. So today, we're going to do that and we're going to use lentils. The pink one looks like it
might be the smallest to me, so I'm going to start with that
one and compare the volumes. So here is my pink pyramid. I'm going to open up the base
and pour in some lentils. Let's see. Let's get it nice and flat. This pyramid now is
filled with our lentils. And now, let's pour it
into the yellow pyramid. So let's see, when I
pour all of the lentils into the yellow pyramid, and
I'm gonna smooth them all out, the lentils fit perfectly. So this tells us that the
volume of the pink pyramid and the yellow pyramid are the same. And now, let's check the green pyramid. What do you think? Do you think the volume will be the same? Alright, let's see. Looks like I've lost a
few lentils. That's okay. So now, when I smooth them out, it fits. And so this tells me that the volume of all three pyramids are the same. So we've just seen that the shapes of these pyramids are different. Their bases are different dimensions and their heights are different, but the volumes are the same,
and that's really interesting. So the reason why this is important is because we want to go back to our original rectangular prism. So even though the pyramids
are different shapes, they all have the same volume. Since they form a
rectangular prism altogether, their volumes are each 1/3 of
the total volume of the prism. To formalize what we just
discovered, the volume of a rectangular pyramid,
one of these guys, is 1/3 the volume of a rectangular prism with the same base area and height. I hope seeing some visuals makes the formulas make more sense.

Arizona: Meet Khan Academy & Khanmigo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39mIq44PXXY,"- Hi everyone. Welcome to our webinar
to discuss the good news. We officially have a partnership with ADE for this school year to
fund Khanmigo for students and it's broadly across
the state of Arizona. So if you are a member of a public school district in Arizona, you are in the right place. And as we wait for everyone to join, I'd love if you just wanna
go ahead and throw your name and your school district in the chat. I'll give you a second, we'll start to welcome everyone in and we are going to get kicking right off. All right, we'll take a peek while you're putting those
names in districts in the chat, we'll take a peek at our agenda. So we're gonna walk
through some introductions, Khanmigo overview and look at the Arizona
partnership specifics and then next steps in Q&A. But we have 45 minutes. It's definitely gonna be fast and furious and I want to make sure you
have everything you need to know leaving this session about the partnership with Khan Academy in Arizona. If you have questions
before the Q&A at the end, definitely feel free to
just throw them in the chat and our lovely team will
be here to assist you all and definitely get
those questions answered or we will have that time at the end. So let's kick it off
with some introductions. Speaking of that lovely team of ours, I'd like to introduce the Arizona team who will be supporting district partners with implementation
and training this year. First up, I'm myself. I'm Chelsea Hatchard,
Nice to meet you all. I support sales and outreach
to potential districts in the west and specifically Arizona. I previously was a sixth
grade math teacher myself and I'm based in Southern California. I'm now gonna pass it over to, do we have Jennifer on the line? - Yes, absolutely. Hi, I am Jennifer Cummings. I am the professional Learning Specialist for the Arizona team. I also am a former educator. I lived my life in junior high as the teacher and administrator and I am based in North central Texas. I am super excited for the opportunity to partner with you and your district and support Arizona teachers. Thank you so much for being here today - And we have Francis. - Good afternoon everybody. I'm Francis Barreto, I'll be supporting Arizona as
the District Success Manager. I am also in the north central Texas area and I'm very excited about partnering potentially
with all of you in Arizona. Thank you. - Alright, so for those of
you that may be familiar with Khan Academy already, and you know we've been
around for some time, you may be thinking, ""Wait, isn't Khan Academy already free?"" And yes, yes it is already free. Our mission is a free
world class education for anyone anywhere. So that means all that our courses and content that you
see here on the screen is already free to students and educators. And the best part is
you never have to choose which courses you wanna use, you get to use them all. I know we're often very
synonymous with math and that's kind of our roots of where we started with math videos. But as you can see, our courses have definitely
expanded over the years to now include everything from sciences, social studies, even
Khanmigo for educators, which is an awesome free course
to get teachers certified in how to use the teacher AI tools. And speaking of those teacher AI tools, those are actually free now as well. So in partnership with Microsoft, all of the teacher, 20 plus
teacher Khanmigo tools are free. So if you think lesson
planning, rubric generation, things for differentiation
and so much more, which we'll take a look at closer when we hop in live to the platform, but both our content and our courses as well as Khanmigo tools are already free now for you and district educators. So then the big kind of next question is, if it's at all that is already free, what is covered with the ADE partnership? Why do you need the ADE partnership? So Khanmigo courses, like I said, and Khanmigo teacher tools are free. This is a look at what I like to call the partnership difference, which highlights the benefits
of that paid partnership and and those components
that are covered now with the ADE partnership. So our district partnership includes, you can kind of see here, additional supports and services provided by our lovely Arizona team who you just met, Francis and Jennifer, and that's professional
development, implementation support. And these things we've
seen have been invaluable, especially with the implementation of AI and districts trying to
navigate what that looks like. So we've seen a lot of
success with districts who have been able to leverage
their supports and services. But then you also get additional things like auto rostering, scaled
up data and analytics, and then lastly the big
shiny exciting thing Khanmigo for students. So that is the AI student tutor component that's student facing instead of just the teacher facing tools. And all of this is now
made available to you at no cost as a partnership with ADE. So a lot of words to say a lot of things, but I'm gonna hop in
live to the platform now and be able to show you
guys a little bit about more about what I'm talking
about and take a peek. So let's switch gears here. All right, so you guys should all be able to see my screen now. And what you're looking at currently is all of our courses that we offer. So I showed you that
snapshot a second earlier, but we are definitely
expanded beyond math videos. You can see we definitely have
a depth of math content here, but also starting as in middle school and through high school we
have sciences, economics, arts and humanity courses. Financial literacy was a
new course that came out. AI for education and
Khanmigo for students. So they're able to kind
of explore AI literacy and what that looks like, and then a ton of partner
courses and additional resources. So you have all of this at
your fingertips already. Like I said, at risk would
sound like a broken record, it's free. And then you have those teacher tools. So these teacher tools also free. They have five kind of
general buckets here. So plan, create, differentiate,
support and learn. Your teachers can start using these today and they have the ability to
kind of sift through here. There's quite a lot here, 20 plus tools that teachers can use. So they have the ability
to favorite as well and if they wanted to
only view their favorites. So the ones that are kind
of committing to start using in the classroom now,
they can do that as well. And then there are some that
are more standalone activities. So I can come in and just
create a lesson plan, push that information in or create a discussion prompt for example. And then there are some
tools that are tied to our Khan Academy
courses like I showed you. So if you have students that are utilizing our Algebra One course or something of that nature, you have the ability to come in and get real time data and
analytics based on that. So I could look at my rostered class, my Algebra One students and then this is a class snapshot that gives me every seven days
kind of some digestible data about where my kids are at currently and how I can adjust or support
them from where they're at. So being able to really give some data informed instruction real time. You have the ability to click
in to even deeper reports and under your your teacher dashboard, teachers are able to see those reports. But this like I said,
is kind of a bite-size, super actionable every seven days. And so Khanmigo, the AI is
synthesizing all that data and then allowing you to
kind of get next steps and digest what students are working on. So I can see this whole snapshot here. Then if I wanted to, I can click into those deeper reports or it gives me some suggestions
of things I could next who should be celebrated for their work on their assignments this week. So I can ask who should be celebrated and it's gonna tell me who's
done really great work. In this case we're bad students, none of us have done our work. Who needs a check-in maybe
would be a better question for us demo students here today. But so it's gonna give you
those kind of action next steps. The other one that is tied to the work that students are doing is this recommended assignments. So if you click in here, you're able to see based on
what students are working on, where the skills are that they have, what Khanmigo recommends
that they do next. So you can select again
a course or a class that you have students set up in and then you're able to see
what the recommendations are for those next steps for them. Maybe it's videos, articles and exercise that they should work on based on kind of their skill level. So in this case it broke the students up into three different groups
based on how they're sitting and the recommendations of what that they should be working on based on their skills. Then I have the ability to
directly assign out from here. I can ask questions to Khanmigo
and kind of continue on. A last tool I'm gonna hop into and obviously there's a lot here and we could spend our whole time together digging into this. But the last tool I'm gonna click into is make it relevant. This one I think is
particularly fun for me because as a teacher,
I don't know about you. Like I said, I was a
sixth grade math teacher and the amount of times I
would try and find a topic that could make it
interesting or a lesson hook and I don't know, for
the longest time a ratio is always stuck out to
me because students, it always gave you cooking. It was like, ""Oh, how to bake a cake."" And I was like, ""Sixth graders
don't mind my sixth graders, at least maybe yours, don't care about baking cake."" So it wasn't the most relevant hook, but that's all I ever
found on the internet. So being able to say something like, I wanna calculate mean, median
and mode with my students, that's what I want them to be doing. That's the lesson that we're working on. But my students, you know, don't care about X, Y, and
Z that I think is cool. Maybe they care about soccer and that's like what matters to them. I can then in seconds at my fingertips have things that are relevant to my kids that are aligned to what I'm
trying to teach or introduce. And it didn't take me
all night researching, I know nothing about soccer. It didn't take me all night researching player performance stats
or things of that nature. I have it at my fingertips right now and it's gonna be relevant
and interesting to them. And we know that that
engagement piece is huge in getting them bought in. So, then you have this here. You're able to, you'll notice it looks
like a working document and that's very intentional. We want this to look
like a working document because we want the fingerprints
of the teacher on it. It's not meant to be something you just click and print and you're done. It's meant to save you time and be able to be able
to be more personalized and differentiated for those students. So now the teacher can come
in, they can ask questions, they can change things if they want. And then when they're ready, they can print, export,
do all of that good stuff. But you'll see here it
gave them a cool idea or for collecting scores
for soccer matches and being able to calculate based on the real team that they follow. So now that kid is excited, they got to watch the soccer game and that became their homework, right? Or that became a project
that they're working on. So that's one of my
personal favorite tools. But not only do you have teacher tools as kind of standalone activities, you also can utilize them within a course. So if I am... You're gonna see my bias
towards sixth grade math again. If I am in a course and I know I'm going to
be teaching unit one, Basic Ratios for my
students, it's coming up. I now have right here at
my fingertips up at the top the ability to create an
exit ticket from here, a lesson plan. So I could click in and
then create a lesson plan and it knows. Okay, this is the standards
that you're working on, this is the topic, go ahead and create that lesson plan. If I wanted to do it from my tool section, I'm able to. I would just have to push in the standard I'm looking at,
the learning objective I want and then it would be able to build it out the same way from there. So you kind of have optionality
in how you want to do that. But what you'll see here
it's super nice is that, comparatively to like going
on to maybe other platforms, ChatGPT in general and having to kind of build out a really kind of specific prompt. All I had to do was a standard, well all I had to do was
click in from a course. But even easier, you could just do a standard
or learning objective and now it already understands the flow and what a lesson plan should look like. It already has my learning
objective built in. My warmup, my direct instruction, right? I didn't have to give it a ton
of information for it to know what a solid lesson plan should look like. Then I have the ability while
I'm here to make adjustments. So if I want to do a different warmup, I don't wanna do a number talk, I can click in and ask it to change it, make some changes or
try something different. If I wanna include manipulatives. In this case it already did, but I could have said you know, I wanna include small groups or you know, I want to
have my exit tickets. I want an easy medium and hard exit ticket or mild, medium and spicy, right? So you can start to get creative there. You also can then ask for strategies to go along with your lessons. So can I have the strategies to go along with this lesson. So you can ask for
instructional resources. It understands kind of
common educational language and acronyms and things of that nature. It is kind of already
frontloaded with that. So it knows that's to support
English language learners. It's giving me ideas about visual aids or a specific sentence frame. The ratio of two is blank. And so it's kind of giving me tools that I can already start
to use and implement with this lesson. Couple other things I do wanna show you is now from the student side. So these are all teacher facing tools. Like I said, you already
have access to those today along with the courses. But part of that ADE partnership is really the the student
experience and the student tools. So let's hop in really quick. Let's go back to, go back
in sixth grade ratios here. And so as a teacher, I have that ability to kind of create some of those things there. As a student, I have the companion mode on the side or my little buddy on the side. I have student mode on here. It's gonna gimme some
dynamic action bubbles or some prompts to kind of get me started. This is a nice way to scaffold
for me if maybe I'm stuck and I don't really know what I don't know. I just know that I don't know the answer to this question, right? So it'll give me ones
like help me solve this or the classic age old, why should I care about
learning this my favorite. But you could click one of those. If I click help me solve this, it can start to work through this with me. You also have the ability
while it's thinking here, the ability to use text
to speech, speech to text. For math, you have the math
keys to be able to input, but it says sure, let's work through this together. How many total pieces of
fruit are in the bowl, right? I can say I can use classic taxi language, IDK, I don't know. I can be rather simple in my responses and it's gonna continue to
prompt and push me forward without giving away the answer. You'll notice it does
say calculating here. So we've added in a layer of calculator to support with the math accuracy. Says let's try adding numbers
of each of the fruit bowls. You have eight bananas,
five oranges, three apples. What do you get when
you add those together? If I say nope, just give me the answer. I don't wanna add the bowls, the fruit. spoiler alert, it should
not give me the answer. You shall see, drum roll. I can't give you the answer directly, but I can help you find it. Let's find out, Add the number of bananas together, right? So it's gonna continue to work with me. That's part of the guardrails
that are in place there to not give away the answer and to act as that good Socratic tutor. Some other guardrails to note, is if I were to say
something inappropriate, sexual, violent, things of that nature, we do have moderation flags. So that would be flagged and the the chat would be shut down. And we also, all the chats
are logged in viewable for both the student to
revisit and the teacher to see. Couple other things you do
have that I didn't mention. Preferences, you have the
ability to change the language. So it defaults to supporting in English, but it can in Spanish,
Hindi or Portuguese. And then you have the ability to change like the reading style
or level from simple, which is about second grade, standards, sixth, then Professorial is
that collegiate level. So some things that you can
do there in companion mode. But as a student, it doesn't have to only
be tied to the courses just like with those teacher tools. So if I'm using the courses
and I need help, amazing. If I'm watching a video or an article, it can summarize the video, quiz me on the video or article, things of that nature. But sometimes I'm using a textbook or I have a project that
I need help with, right? And it's not solely only
content I'm accessing through Khan Academy. So in that case your learner activities, they have kind of their own set of dashboard activities
that they can work through. Mainly the two popular ones here being Tutor me:Math and science
and Tutor me: Humanities. So those are our two kind of big buckets that students can bring information and push that information in. So think Tutor me:Math and science, maybe I have a test coming up or a word problem I'm stuck with or something from my textbook
that I need help with, and this is my place that I
can come and push that in. In this case, let's say
I have a test coming up, I can say give me five practice problems. It's gonna wanna know on what, right? So is it math, science,
things of that nature. So I could say math, maybe I am grade five,
multiplying fractions, right? And you'll see those
dynamic action bubbles continue to pop up and give them kind of
scaffolding and support, but you can always type
in whatever you want. Wonderful, now it's gonna
gimme five practice problems. Which one do I wanna start first? And I can start working
through that and getting help. If I have questions on
how to multiply fractions, I can start asking that. Maybe I don't understand the process and I can get help there. The other one Tutor me:Humanities, similar experience but for
those humanities things. So I can come and what's
nice about this is, we do have a lot of math and science content on our platform, but just because it's not on our platform doesn't mean Khanmigo can't support. So say ""Romeo and Juliet"", for example. We don't have the entire play of ""Romeo and Juliet"" on our site, but the AI can still support. So if I say I need help exploring themes of ""Romeo and Juliet"", but maybe I have to do a a project on it, write an essay, who knows? Awesome, it's rich in themes. Instead of just giving me
information right off the bat, let's explore what themes
have you noticed so far? So putting that onus backed on me, prompting and getting me engaged. Love and loss and I made a typo and it's gonna push right through that. Great, love and loss are essential themes. How do you see these themes
affecting the characters? So it's continuing to go
back and forth with me and I can continue to have
like that thought partner or brainstorm as I'm
exploring those themes. Another very exciting piece
on the humanities side is gonna be Writing Coach. So this is our newest iteration
of this is very exciting. There are some Khanmigo tools that are assignable which is awesome. So not only Writing Coach. but like chat with the
literary or historical figure. Those tutor me sections and a few others. Teachers can actually push out, so you can be able to
tailor that experience that you want students
to have with the AI. If you don't want them just having to come and put information in, maybe just as a way to
bring their questions, you could say, ""Hey, I want you to go to Ignite my curiosity
and it's an assignment out and I want you to explore
gene mutations and families. and then we're all gonna
share back what we learned or something of that nature."" So you do have some
control and flexibility to be able to push out assignments. Particularly with Writing Coach, this is one way you can do that. So you could assign an assignment
which is being an essay. You're able to put in the essay title, the grade level, the essay type, and then any essay instruction. So any parameters that
you have for the students, including a word count. Once you have that essay
type in or your essay in, you also will eventually receive reports. So you're able to see on that report if the students have started, what they've updated, the time they've spent, word count, any writing feedback they're getting And then an originality meter. Mainly our goal with Writing Coach is to be an instructional tool, not so much a grading tool and not so much like an AI sheet detector, but this originality meter
will let you know that like, ""Hey your students were
working on this essay and then all of a sudden copied and pasted the whole conclusion in."" So it will give you flags
for things like that. On the student side, if you pushed out that assignment, here's little demo essay, it would look like something like this. So they would start at understanding and the student's going to go ahead and get this essay prompt that the the teacher assigned out to them, has all the information
the teacher put in, those prompt instructions. And then what they have
which is really nice is throughout this entire writing process, they have this little buddy on the side, Khanmigo that's working through with them, making sure they understand
every step of the way and giving them real
time feedback and support so that you're not
completing a whole essay and then waiting two,
three, four weeks sometimes to get any feedback back on
that version of your essay. So here, this is the spot to make sure, ""Do you even understand
what I'm being asked to do?"" They ask them to explain the essay prompt. ""I don't know what a persuasive essay is. Can you explain that essay type to me?"" Sure it explains the essay type. Uses some language that
maybe I don't understand, what is a counter argument, right? So I'm able to walk through
and get support there. Once I feel good, I understand the essay prompt, I move into outlining. The lost art of outlining. I don't know about any of you, but in my days in school we would cut up pieces of paper
and you shifted it around. This is like the digital version of that where you can cut and move it around. It's flex a flexible outline to be able to add in all
the the body paragraphs, the evidence and all of that good stuff. But then again you still have
that Khanmigo on the side acting as a support. So are my sources done
properly in MLA format? I'm stuck. No worries, let's break
it down step by step. You already have a strong
thesis and some good points. Let's focus on refining and
reasoning and explanations. So it starts working with me. But if I ask something
again to the effect of like, give me the answer
right, give me a thesis, I can't provide you a thesis, but I can help you refine yours. I already had one in here so it's not gonna give
me a brand new thesis. Once I feel good about my outline, I move into that drafting phase. I have my outline on the side
to kind of pop things back in and then I head into revising. Now I have feedback in these kind of five general buckets here. In this case 19 pieces of feedback. Some are positive, your introduction clearly
states your stance on daylight savings time, good job, and then some are more constructive on things I can do to improve. So in this introduction
it could be even stronger if you considered
providing more background evidence or information. If I have questions on
that, I can then click in. Same thing if I have kind
of that conversation. It'll always give me
those prompts like I said. In this case it said,
""Do you want an example?"" Sure. So it gives me an example
not on daylight savings time, which I could then just copy
and paste into my own essay. It does one on left-handed
and right-handed people and it's a fascinating topic. Gives me a general intro and then one with more background to highlight what it's asking me to do. So that is kind of the
bulk of Writing Coach. And like I said, that's not the only kind
of standalone activity. There are quite a few others out here and a lot of these are even assignable. But without further ado, I think we're gonna pop back in. That was our fast and furious version of Khanmigo for students
and teacher tools. Thank you very much. So another thing, I loosely high alluded to
this in the demo there, but we do take data privacy and safe use of AI super seriously. And like I mentioned, teachers have access
to student chat history as well as receive moderation
flags for inappropriate chats. We don't use teacher and
student chats to train the model and no data information is
passed back to open to AI. Teachers also have the ability
to turn Khanmigo on and off. So during Khanmigo, when you're on Khan Academy if you're doing a quiz or a test, it already just won't appear. But if you're on the internet and you're taking a quiz or a test and then they have Khanmigo up, you can turn it off on focus
mode for up to four hours. And lastly, we've invested
in privacy, security and compliance measures for districts. So we have committed
to a Soc 2 Type audits, FERPA, COPPA compliant and compliant with all state
data privacy regulations. Now on to the good stuff. So hopefully by this point we are excited by the potential of what
Khanmigo can do for students in your district, in your classrooms. But let's talk nuts and bolts of the partnership
requirements for Arizona. So mainly you do need to
be a public school district or a public charter within Arizona. You need to be serving
grades five through 12. So this is focused in on
students grades five through 12. You need to have a minimum of
250 students in those grades. So if you're looking to target fifth, sixth, and seventh grade, you need to have 250
students within those grades or nine through 12,
something of that nature. You are able to partner
on grade level or school. So if you wanted to look
at across your district, all your sixth graders, or if you have an initiative to support ninth graders in math, right? So you can look at bucketing it that way. it doesn't have to be a
whole district partnership, it could be by grade level or by school as long as you're
hitting that 250 minimum. And then we do need clever or
class link for auto rostering. So that is how we roster
through those single sign-ons. So you will need one of those. And then the exciting stuff is, as I've already mentioned before, it's a 100% free of charge to you all. The partnership runs
through June 30th, 2025. So the end of this school year. There's no expectations on the DOE side of kind of implementation and
what it looks like for you. So however you're looking
and envision using this, there's no kind of mandates by Arizona. And then lastly, it is first come, first serve. So they have committed
to a 100,00 licenses broadly across Arizona and we are just giving those out first come first serve basis so that the sooner you
join us, the better. Speaking of joining us, we've already begun
onboarding and partnering with some awesome districts in Arizona and we can't wait to have you
be a part of that as well. You'll see a few listed here and there's even more to come. So I'm excited to continue partnering. Well that is, we're at about time. We have a few minutes left but I am going to be staying on, feel free to throw questions
in the chat please. But I wanted to thank you all
for joining the webinar today and I hope you found
this information valuable and are excited about the potential of partnering with Khan Academy and Khanmigo for your students. Yeah, and here's a few ways that whether you throw
questions in the chat now, but you can also email me directly at chelseahatchard@khanacademy.org, or you can visit the
blog that's linked here and that has all the
kind of nuts and bolts, everything you need to know
about the Arizona partnership. And then there's also
this QR code that scans and that sends all of your
information to me directly and I'm happy to reach out. So couple of ways to get in touch with me if that's what you're looking to do. Now, I don't know if there's, kick it over to the chat and
see if we have any questions. - Chelsea, there was a
question about private schools that was answered in the chat. I don't know if you wanna- - Yeah. Unfortunately, yeah. Private schools are not included. It is, if you're a public charter, that works but... - How could Khanmigo support career and technical education programs? - We do. I mean there's a ton of courses on there that you could take a peek at and see if there's anything that kind
of meets your specific needs and I'd be happy to discuss further. Jennifer, do you have any, or I mean either, Francis, do you have anything to add to that in terms of specifically supporting career and technical education programs? - I just would add that
that our coursework under the life skills as well as just preparing for SAT and additional college and
career readiness opportunities, those are all courses that are available. And Khanmigo, the
student side of Khanmigo, there's actually some learner activities that are built in specifically for college admissions, college essays, even doing research on potential careers. And so there are definitely
places that could, you could infuse the learner activities for specific career and
technical education programming. Yes, and Francis just added computing courses for
programming and Python as well. So those are all additional things and as Chelsea pointed out, all of those courses are available through the partnership and they're free. So if you aren't able to partner with us for whatever reason, those courses are also available. - Marnie, great question. I will clarify. So what is already free
is Khan Academy courses and teacher tools. What is not free is Khanmigo for students. So that any AI Khanmigo tools
that are student facing. So I just showed you Writing
Coach, the Companion Mode, Tutor me:Math and science,
Tutor me:Humanities, all of that stuff. Anything student facing
Khanmigo is not free and Arizona, DOE is
footing the bill for that and covering that partnership. So it's free to you in
partnership with us, but it is not typically free. So that is the real benefit there and then you're also getting
supports and services. So the lovely help of
Jennifer and Francis, which I guess that is invaluable in terms of AI specifically, the biggest piece of feedback
I think we've received is even from teachers
is that rolling this out so much more successful when you have a professional development and an implementation
specialist supporting. 'Cause it is so new and especially the time
we are in the year, right? Implementing mid-year is kind of hard, so making sure teachers feel supported and have kind of all
the tools that they need to be successful with
rolling this out to kids. School under 250 could participate. At this time I can send
you over some free tools for schools under 250, but at this time unfortunately, the the formal partnership no, but we could get you some
resources to support. If you want to email me, Tina and I would be happy to
send you over what I have. Oh yeah, and Francis sorry to your point, you do get scaled update and analytics for the paid partnership. So essentially the free
version is like teachers and the paid version is a district, right? So now the principals have
lines of site into how the school is doing, the
curriculum directors, right? You have more scaled update and analytics in a more macro view
versus the free version, is just mainly teacher tools. - There is also a really
great teacher tool that comes with that data reporting that the free version does
not allow for class snapshot. And so thinking about the amount of time that teachers spend trying
to disaggregate data, extrapolate and pull from
multiple different places, there is one tool that
with a click of a button it can give you a seven day overview of how your students are performing and that is part of the
paid partnership as well. - And Tina, to your point
for the umbrella of schools. If you guys are all on the same like clever or class link instance, that's something we could explore. But if they're all
individually like rostered, then it looks a little different. Absolutely, if you have no more questions, feel free to leave. And thank you so much. We're hanging around for
another couple minutes just to if there's any other questions. But again, thank you for your time. If you're interested in learning more or moving forward with partnership, feel free to email me or scan
that QR code like we said. Yes, my email is in the chat and the Jennifer maybe can throw
that link back in, perfect. - There is the link, absolutely. - Thank you all so much
and happy Halloween almost. We have Halloween tomorrow, I don't know about any of you. Taking my one-year-old who is protesting, dressing up like mini mouse out. So good luck to all of
those parents out there. All right, I think we are good to go. Thank you all. Oh, one more message. Yep, perfect. Bye everybody.",Khanmigo Partnership with ADE,"Khan Academy has partnered with the Arizona Department of Education (ADE) to provide free access to Khanmigo, an educational platform for students, across the state of Arizona.",00:00:00 - 00:02:00,2024-10-31T16:51:15Z,5210,57,1
Arizona: Meet Khan Academy & Khanmigo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39mIq44PXXY,"- Hi everyone. Welcome to our webinar
to discuss the good news. We officially have a partnership with ADE for this school year to
fund Khanmigo for students and it's broadly across
the state of Arizona. So if you are a member of a public school district in Arizona, you are in the right place. And as we wait for everyone to join, I'd love if you just wanna
go ahead and throw your name and your school district in the chat. I'll give you a second, we'll start to welcome everyone in and we are going to get kicking right off. All right, we'll take a peek while you're putting those
names in districts in the chat, we'll take a peek at our agenda. So we're gonna walk
through some introductions, Khanmigo overview and look at the Arizona
partnership specifics and then next steps in Q&A. But we have 45 minutes. It's definitely gonna be fast and furious and I want to make sure you
have everything you need to know leaving this session about the partnership with Khan Academy in Arizona. If you have questions
before the Q&A at the end, definitely feel free to
just throw them in the chat and our lovely team will
be here to assist you all and definitely get
those questions answered or we will have that time at the end. So let's kick it off
with some introductions. Speaking of that lovely team of ours, I'd like to introduce the Arizona team who will be supporting district partners with implementation
and training this year. First up, I'm myself. I'm Chelsea Hatchard,
Nice to meet you all. I support sales and outreach
to potential districts in the west and specifically Arizona. I previously was a sixth
grade math teacher myself and I'm based in Southern California. I'm now gonna pass it over to, do we have Jennifer on the line? - Yes, absolutely. Hi, I am Jennifer Cummings. I am the professional Learning Specialist for the Arizona team. I also am a former educator. I lived my life in junior high as the teacher and administrator and I am based in North central Texas. I am super excited for the opportunity to partner with you and your district and support Arizona teachers. Thank you so much for being here today - And we have Francis. - Good afternoon everybody. I'm Francis Barreto, I'll be supporting Arizona as
the District Success Manager. I am also in the north central Texas area and I'm very excited about partnering potentially
with all of you in Arizona. Thank you. - Alright, so for those of
you that may be familiar with Khan Academy already, and you know we've been
around for some time, you may be thinking, ""Wait, isn't Khan Academy already free?"" And yes, yes it is already free. Our mission is a free
world class education for anyone anywhere. So that means all that our courses and content that you
see here on the screen is already free to students and educators. And the best part is
you never have to choose which courses you wanna use, you get to use them all. I know we're often very
synonymous with math and that's kind of our roots of where we started with math videos. But as you can see, our courses have definitely
expanded over the years to now include everything from sciences, social studies, even
Khanmigo for educators, which is an awesome free course
to get teachers certified in how to use the teacher AI tools. And speaking of those teacher AI tools, those are actually free now as well. So in partnership with Microsoft, all of the teacher, 20 plus
teacher Khanmigo tools are free. So if you think lesson
planning, rubric generation, things for differentiation
and so much more, which we'll take a look at closer when we hop in live to the platform, but both our content and our courses as well as Khanmigo tools are already free now for you and district educators. So then the big kind of next question is, if it's at all that is already free, what is covered with the ADE partnership? Why do you need the ADE partnership? So Khanmigo courses, like I said, and Khanmigo teacher tools are free. This is a look at what I like to call the partnership difference, which highlights the benefits
of that paid partnership and and those components
that are covered now with the ADE partnership. So our district partnership includes, you can kind of see here, additional supports and services provided by our lovely Arizona team who you just met, Francis and Jennifer, and that's professional
development, implementation support. And these things we've
seen have been invaluable, especially with the implementation of AI and districts trying to
navigate what that looks like. So we've seen a lot of
success with districts who have been able to leverage
their supports and services. But then you also get additional things like auto rostering, scaled
up data and analytics, and then lastly the big
shiny exciting thing Khanmigo for students. So that is the AI student tutor component that's student facing instead of just the teacher facing tools. And all of this is now
made available to you at no cost as a partnership with ADE. So a lot of words to say a lot of things, but I'm gonna hop in
live to the platform now and be able to show you
guys a little bit about more about what I'm talking
about and take a peek. So let's switch gears here. All right, so you guys should all be able to see my screen now. And what you're looking at currently is all of our courses that we offer. So I showed you that
snapshot a second earlier, but we are definitely
expanded beyond math videos. You can see we definitely have
a depth of math content here, but also starting as in middle school and through high school we
have sciences, economics, arts and humanity courses. Financial literacy was a
new course that came out. AI for education and
Khanmigo for students. So they're able to kind
of explore AI literacy and what that looks like, and then a ton of partner
courses and additional resources. So you have all of this at
your fingertips already. Like I said, at risk would
sound like a broken record, it's free. And then you have those teacher tools. So these teacher tools also free. They have five kind of
general buckets here. So plan, create, differentiate,
support and learn. Your teachers can start using these today and they have the ability to
kind of sift through here. There's quite a lot here, 20 plus tools that teachers can use. So they have the ability
to favorite as well and if they wanted to
only view their favorites. So the ones that are kind
of committing to start using in the classroom now,
they can do that as well. And then there are some that
are more standalone activities. So I can come in and just
create a lesson plan, push that information in or create a discussion prompt for example. And then there are some
tools that are tied to our Khan Academy
courses like I showed you. So if you have students that are utilizing our Algebra One course or something of that nature, you have the ability to come in and get real time data and
analytics based on that. So I could look at my rostered class, my Algebra One students and then this is a class snapshot that gives me every seven days
kind of some digestible data about where my kids are at currently and how I can adjust or support
them from where they're at. So being able to really give some data informed instruction real time. You have the ability to click
in to even deeper reports and under your your teacher dashboard, teachers are able to see those reports. But this like I said,
is kind of a bite-size, super actionable every seven days. And so Khanmigo, the AI is
synthesizing all that data and then allowing you to
kind of get next steps and digest what students are working on. So I can see this whole snapshot here. Then if I wanted to, I can click into those deeper reports or it gives me some suggestions
of things I could next who should be celebrated for their work on their assignments this week. So I can ask who should be celebrated and it's gonna tell me who's
done really great work. In this case we're bad students, none of us have done our work. Who needs a check-in maybe
would be a better question for us demo students here today. But so it's gonna give you
those kind of action next steps. The other one that is tied to the work that students are doing is this recommended assignments. So if you click in here, you're able to see based on
what students are working on, where the skills are that they have, what Khanmigo recommends
that they do next. So you can select again
a course or a class that you have students set up in and then you're able to see
what the recommendations are for those next steps for them. Maybe it's videos, articles and exercise that they should work on based on kind of their skill level. So in this case it broke the students up into three different groups
based on how they're sitting and the recommendations of what that they should be working on based on their skills. Then I have the ability to
directly assign out from here. I can ask questions to Khanmigo
and kind of continue on. A last tool I'm gonna hop into and obviously there's a lot here and we could spend our whole time together digging into this. But the last tool I'm gonna click into is make it relevant. This one I think is
particularly fun for me because as a teacher,
I don't know about you. Like I said, I was a
sixth grade math teacher and the amount of times I
would try and find a topic that could make it
interesting or a lesson hook and I don't know, for
the longest time a ratio is always stuck out to
me because students, it always gave you cooking. It was like, ""Oh, how to bake a cake."" And I was like, ""Sixth graders
don't mind my sixth graders, at least maybe yours, don't care about baking cake."" So it wasn't the most relevant hook, but that's all I ever
found on the internet. So being able to say something like, I wanna calculate mean, median
and mode with my students, that's what I want them to be doing. That's the lesson that we're working on. But my students, you know, don't care about X, Y, and
Z that I think is cool. Maybe they care about soccer and that's like what matters to them. I can then in seconds at my fingertips have things that are relevant to my kids that are aligned to what I'm
trying to teach or introduce. And it didn't take me
all night researching, I know nothing about soccer. It didn't take me all night researching player performance stats
or things of that nature. I have it at my fingertips right now and it's gonna be relevant
and interesting to them. And we know that that
engagement piece is huge in getting them bought in. So, then you have this here. You're able to, you'll notice it looks
like a working document and that's very intentional. We want this to look
like a working document because we want the fingerprints
of the teacher on it. It's not meant to be something you just click and print and you're done. It's meant to save you time and be able to be able
to be more personalized and differentiated for those students. So now the teacher can come
in, they can ask questions, they can change things if they want. And then when they're ready, they can print, export,
do all of that good stuff. But you'll see here it
gave them a cool idea or for collecting scores
for soccer matches and being able to calculate based on the real team that they follow. So now that kid is excited, they got to watch the soccer game and that became their homework, right? Or that became a project
that they're working on. So that's one of my
personal favorite tools. But not only do you have teacher tools as kind of standalone activities, you also can utilize them within a course. So if I am... You're gonna see my bias
towards sixth grade math again. If I am in a course and I know I'm going to
be teaching unit one, Basic Ratios for my
students, it's coming up. I now have right here at
my fingertips up at the top the ability to create an
exit ticket from here, a lesson plan. So I could click in and
then create a lesson plan and it knows. Okay, this is the standards
that you're working on, this is the topic, go ahead and create that lesson plan. If I wanted to do it from my tool section, I'm able to. I would just have to push in the standard I'm looking at,
the learning objective I want and then it would be able to build it out the same way from there. So you kind of have optionality
in how you want to do that. But what you'll see here
it's super nice is that, comparatively to like going
on to maybe other platforms, ChatGPT in general and having to kind of build out a really kind of specific prompt. All I had to do was a standard, well all I had to do was
click in from a course. But even easier, you could just do a standard
or learning objective and now it already understands the flow and what a lesson plan should look like. It already has my learning
objective built in. My warmup, my direct instruction, right? I didn't have to give it a ton
of information for it to know what a solid lesson plan should look like. Then I have the ability while
I'm here to make adjustments. So if I want to do a different warmup, I don't wanna do a number talk, I can click in and ask it to change it, make some changes or
try something different. If I wanna include manipulatives. In this case it already did, but I could have said you know, I wanna include small groups or you know, I want to
have my exit tickets. I want an easy medium and hard exit ticket or mild, medium and spicy, right? So you can start to get creative there. You also can then ask for strategies to go along with your lessons. So can I have the strategies to go along with this lesson. So you can ask for
instructional resources. It understands kind of
common educational language and acronyms and things of that nature. It is kind of already
frontloaded with that. So it knows that's to support
English language learners. It's giving me ideas about visual aids or a specific sentence frame. The ratio of two is blank. And so it's kind of giving me tools that I can already start
to use and implement with this lesson. Couple other things I do wanna show you is now from the student side. So these are all teacher facing tools. Like I said, you already
have access to those today along with the courses. But part of that ADE partnership is really the the student
experience and the student tools. So let's hop in really quick. Let's go back to, go back
in sixth grade ratios here. And so as a teacher, I have that ability to kind of create some of those things there. As a student, I have the companion mode on the side or my little buddy on the side. I have student mode on here. It's gonna gimme some
dynamic action bubbles or some prompts to kind of get me started. This is a nice way to scaffold
for me if maybe I'm stuck and I don't really know what I don't know. I just know that I don't know the answer to this question, right? So it'll give me ones
like help me solve this or the classic age old, why should I care about
learning this my favorite. But you could click one of those. If I click help me solve this, it can start to work through this with me. You also have the ability
while it's thinking here, the ability to use text
to speech, speech to text. For math, you have the math
keys to be able to input, but it says sure, let's work through this together. How many total pieces of
fruit are in the bowl, right? I can say I can use classic taxi language, IDK, I don't know. I can be rather simple in my responses and it's gonna continue to
prompt and push me forward without giving away the answer. You'll notice it does
say calculating here. So we've added in a layer of calculator to support with the math accuracy. Says let's try adding numbers
of each of the fruit bowls. You have eight bananas,
five oranges, three apples. What do you get when
you add those together? If I say nope, just give me the answer. I don't wanna add the bowls, the fruit. spoiler alert, it should
not give me the answer. You shall see, drum roll. I can't give you the answer directly, but I can help you find it. Let's find out, Add the number of bananas together, right? So it's gonna continue to work with me. That's part of the guardrails
that are in place there to not give away the answer and to act as that good Socratic tutor. Some other guardrails to note, is if I were to say
something inappropriate, sexual, violent, things of that nature, we do have moderation flags. So that would be flagged and the the chat would be shut down. And we also, all the chats
are logged in viewable for both the student to
revisit and the teacher to see. Couple other things you do
have that I didn't mention. Preferences, you have the
ability to change the language. So it defaults to supporting in English, but it can in Spanish,
Hindi or Portuguese. And then you have the ability to change like the reading style
or level from simple, which is about second grade, standards, sixth, then Professorial is
that collegiate level. So some things that you can
do there in companion mode. But as a student, it doesn't have to only
be tied to the courses just like with those teacher tools. So if I'm using the courses
and I need help, amazing. If I'm watching a video or an article, it can summarize the video, quiz me on the video or article, things of that nature. But sometimes I'm using a textbook or I have a project that
I need help with, right? And it's not solely only
content I'm accessing through Khan Academy. So in that case your learner activities, they have kind of their own set of dashboard activities
that they can work through. Mainly the two popular ones here being Tutor me:Math and science
and Tutor me: Humanities. So those are our two kind of big buckets that students can bring information and push that information in. So think Tutor me:Math and science, maybe I have a test coming up or a word problem I'm stuck with or something from my textbook
that I need help with, and this is my place that I
can come and push that in. In this case, let's say
I have a test coming up, I can say give me five practice problems. It's gonna wanna know on what, right? So is it math, science,
things of that nature. So I could say math, maybe I am grade five,
multiplying fractions, right? And you'll see those
dynamic action bubbles continue to pop up and give them kind of
scaffolding and support, but you can always type
in whatever you want. Wonderful, now it's gonna
gimme five practice problems. Which one do I wanna start first? And I can start working
through that and getting help. If I have questions on
how to multiply fractions, I can start asking that. Maybe I don't understand the process and I can get help there. The other one Tutor me:Humanities, similar experience but for
those humanities things. So I can come and what's
nice about this is, we do have a lot of math and science content on our platform, but just because it's not on our platform doesn't mean Khanmigo can't support. So say ""Romeo and Juliet"", for example. We don't have the entire play of ""Romeo and Juliet"" on our site, but the AI can still support. So if I say I need help exploring themes of ""Romeo and Juliet"", but maybe I have to do a a project on it, write an essay, who knows? Awesome, it's rich in themes. Instead of just giving me
information right off the bat, let's explore what themes
have you noticed so far? So putting that onus backed on me, prompting and getting me engaged. Love and loss and I made a typo and it's gonna push right through that. Great, love and loss are essential themes. How do you see these themes
affecting the characters? So it's continuing to go
back and forth with me and I can continue to have
like that thought partner or brainstorm as I'm
exploring those themes. Another very exciting piece
on the humanities side is gonna be Writing Coach. So this is our newest iteration
of this is very exciting. There are some Khanmigo tools that are assignable which is awesome. So not only Writing Coach. but like chat with the
literary or historical figure. Those tutor me sections and a few others. Teachers can actually push out, so you can be able to
tailor that experience that you want students
to have with the AI. If you don't want them just having to come and put information in, maybe just as a way to
bring their questions, you could say, ""Hey, I want you to go to Ignite my curiosity
and it's an assignment out and I want you to explore
gene mutations and families. and then we're all gonna
share back what we learned or something of that nature."" So you do have some
control and flexibility to be able to push out assignments. Particularly with Writing Coach, this is one way you can do that. So you could assign an assignment
which is being an essay. You're able to put in the essay title, the grade level, the essay type, and then any essay instruction. So any parameters that
you have for the students, including a word count. Once you have that essay
type in or your essay in, you also will eventually receive reports. So you're able to see on that report if the students have started, what they've updated, the time they've spent, word count, any writing feedback they're getting And then an originality meter. Mainly our goal with Writing Coach is to be an instructional tool, not so much a grading tool and not so much like an AI sheet detector, but this originality meter
will let you know that like, ""Hey your students were
working on this essay and then all of a sudden copied and pasted the whole conclusion in."" So it will give you flags
for things like that. On the student side, if you pushed out that assignment, here's little demo essay, it would look like something like this. So they would start at understanding and the student's going to go ahead and get this essay prompt that the the teacher assigned out to them, has all the information
the teacher put in, those prompt instructions. And then what they have
which is really nice is throughout this entire writing process, they have this little buddy on the side, Khanmigo that's working through with them, making sure they understand
every step of the way and giving them real
time feedback and support so that you're not
completing a whole essay and then waiting two,
three, four weeks sometimes to get any feedback back on
that version of your essay. So here, this is the spot to make sure, ""Do you even understand
what I'm being asked to do?"" They ask them to explain the essay prompt. ""I don't know what a persuasive essay is. Can you explain that essay type to me?"" Sure it explains the essay type. Uses some language that
maybe I don't understand, what is a counter argument, right? So I'm able to walk through
and get support there. Once I feel good, I understand the essay prompt, I move into outlining. The lost art of outlining. I don't know about any of you, but in my days in school we would cut up pieces of paper
and you shifted it around. This is like the digital version of that where you can cut and move it around. It's flex a flexible outline to be able to add in all
the the body paragraphs, the evidence and all of that good stuff. But then again you still have
that Khanmigo on the side acting as a support. So are my sources done
properly in MLA format? I'm stuck. No worries, let's break
it down step by step. You already have a strong
thesis and some good points. Let's focus on refining and
reasoning and explanations. So it starts working with me. But if I ask something
again to the effect of like, give me the answer
right, give me a thesis, I can't provide you a thesis, but I can help you refine yours. I already had one in here so it's not gonna give
me a brand new thesis. Once I feel good about my outline, I move into that drafting phase. I have my outline on the side
to kind of pop things back in and then I head into revising. Now I have feedback in these kind of five general buckets here. In this case 19 pieces of feedback. Some are positive, your introduction clearly
states your stance on daylight savings time, good job, and then some are more constructive on things I can do to improve. So in this introduction
it could be even stronger if you considered
providing more background evidence or information. If I have questions on
that, I can then click in. Same thing if I have kind
of that conversation. It'll always give me
those prompts like I said. In this case it said,
""Do you want an example?"" Sure. So it gives me an example
not on daylight savings time, which I could then just copy
and paste into my own essay. It does one on left-handed
and right-handed people and it's a fascinating topic. Gives me a general intro and then one with more background to highlight what it's asking me to do. So that is kind of the
bulk of Writing Coach. And like I said, that's not the only kind
of standalone activity. There are quite a few others out here and a lot of these are even assignable. But without further ado, I think we're gonna pop back in. That was our fast and furious version of Khanmigo for students
and teacher tools. Thank you very much. So another thing, I loosely high alluded to
this in the demo there, but we do take data privacy and safe use of AI super seriously. And like I mentioned, teachers have access
to student chat history as well as receive moderation
flags for inappropriate chats. We don't use teacher and
student chats to train the model and no data information is
passed back to open to AI. Teachers also have the ability
to turn Khanmigo on and off. So during Khanmigo, when you're on Khan Academy if you're doing a quiz or a test, it already just won't appear. But if you're on the internet and you're taking a quiz or a test and then they have Khanmigo up, you can turn it off on focus
mode for up to four hours. And lastly, we've invested
in privacy, security and compliance measures for districts. So we have committed
to a Soc 2 Type audits, FERPA, COPPA compliant and compliant with all state
data privacy regulations. Now on to the good stuff. So hopefully by this point we are excited by the potential of what
Khanmigo can do for students in your district, in your classrooms. But let's talk nuts and bolts of the partnership
requirements for Arizona. So mainly you do need to
be a public school district or a public charter within Arizona. You need to be serving
grades five through 12. So this is focused in on
students grades five through 12. You need to have a minimum of
250 students in those grades. So if you're looking to target fifth, sixth, and seventh grade, you need to have 250
students within those grades or nine through 12,
something of that nature. You are able to partner
on grade level or school. So if you wanted to look
at across your district, all your sixth graders, or if you have an initiative to support ninth graders in math, right? So you can look at bucketing it that way. it doesn't have to be a
whole district partnership, it could be by grade level or by school as long as you're
hitting that 250 minimum. And then we do need clever or
class link for auto rostering. So that is how we roster
through those single sign-ons. So you will need one of those. And then the exciting stuff is, as I've already mentioned before, it's a 100% free of charge to you all. The partnership runs
through June 30th, 2025. So the end of this school year. There's no expectations on the DOE side of kind of implementation and
what it looks like for you. So however you're looking
and envision using this, there's no kind of mandates by Arizona. And then lastly, it is first come, first serve. So they have committed
to a 100,00 licenses broadly across Arizona and we are just giving those out first come first serve basis so that the sooner you
join us, the better. Speaking of joining us, we've already begun
onboarding and partnering with some awesome districts in Arizona and we can't wait to have you
be a part of that as well. You'll see a few listed here and there's even more to come. So I'm excited to continue partnering. Well that is, we're at about time. We have a few minutes left but I am going to be staying on, feel free to throw questions
in the chat please. But I wanted to thank you all
for joining the webinar today and I hope you found
this information valuable and are excited about the potential of partnering with Khan Academy and Khanmigo for your students. Yeah, and here's a few ways that whether you throw
questions in the chat now, but you can also email me directly at chelseahatchard@khanacademy.org, or you can visit the
blog that's linked here and that has all the
kind of nuts and bolts, everything you need to know
about the Arizona partnership. And then there's also
this QR code that scans and that sends all of your
information to me directly and I'm happy to reach out. So couple of ways to get in touch with me if that's what you're looking to do. Now, I don't know if there's, kick it over to the chat and
see if we have any questions. - Chelsea, there was a
question about private schools that was answered in the chat. I don't know if you wanna- - Yeah. Unfortunately, yeah. Private schools are not included. It is, if you're a public charter, that works but... - How could Khanmigo support career and technical education programs? - We do. I mean there's a ton of courses on there that you could take a peek at and see if there's anything that kind
of meets your specific needs and I'd be happy to discuss further. Jennifer, do you have any, or I mean either, Francis, do you have anything to add to that in terms of specifically supporting career and technical education programs? - I just would add that
that our coursework under the life skills as well as just preparing for SAT and additional college and
career readiness opportunities, those are all courses that are available. And Khanmigo, the
student side of Khanmigo, there's actually some learner activities that are built in specifically for college admissions, college essays, even doing research on potential careers. And so there are definitely
places that could, you could infuse the learner activities for specific career and
technical education programming. Yes, and Francis just added computing courses for
programming and Python as well. So those are all additional things and as Chelsea pointed out, all of those courses are available through the partnership and they're free. So if you aren't able to partner with us for whatever reason, those courses are also available. - Marnie, great question. I will clarify. So what is already free
is Khan Academy courses and teacher tools. What is not free is Khanmigo for students. So that any AI Khanmigo tools
that are student facing. So I just showed you Writing
Coach, the Companion Mode, Tutor me:Math and science,
Tutor me:Humanities, all of that stuff. Anything student facing
Khanmigo is not free and Arizona, DOE is
footing the bill for that and covering that partnership. So it's free to you in
partnership with us, but it is not typically free. So that is the real benefit there and then you're also getting
supports and services. So the lovely help of
Jennifer and Francis, which I guess that is invaluable in terms of AI specifically, the biggest piece of feedback
I think we've received is even from teachers
is that rolling this out so much more successful when you have a professional development and an implementation
specialist supporting. 'Cause it is so new and especially the time
we are in the year, right? Implementing mid-year is kind of hard, so making sure teachers feel supported and have kind of all
the tools that they need to be successful with
rolling this out to kids. School under 250 could participate. At this time I can send
you over some free tools for schools under 250, but at this time unfortunately, the the formal partnership no, but we could get you some
resources to support. If you want to email me, Tina and I would be happy to
send you over what I have. Oh yeah, and Francis sorry to your point, you do get scaled update and analytics for the paid partnership. So essentially the free
version is like teachers and the paid version is a district, right? So now the principals have
lines of site into how the school is doing, the
curriculum directors, right? You have more scaled update and analytics in a more macro view
versus the free version, is just mainly teacher tools. - There is also a really
great teacher tool that comes with that data reporting that the free version does
not allow for class snapshot. And so thinking about the amount of time that teachers spend trying
to disaggregate data, extrapolate and pull from
multiple different places, there is one tool that
with a click of a button it can give you a seven day overview of how your students are performing and that is part of the
paid partnership as well. - And Tina, to your point
for the umbrella of schools. If you guys are all on the same like clever or class link instance, that's something we could explore. But if they're all
individually like rostered, then it looks a little different. Absolutely, if you have no more questions, feel free to leave. And thank you so much. We're hanging around for
another couple minutes just to if there's any other questions. But again, thank you for your time. If you're interested in learning more or moving forward with partnership, feel free to email me or scan
that QR code like we said. Yes, my email is in the chat and the Jennifer maybe can throw
that link back in, perfect. - There is the link, absolutely. - Thank you all so much
and happy Halloween almost. We have Halloween tomorrow, I don't know about any of you. Taking my one-year-old who is protesting, dressing up like mini mouse out. So good luck to all of
those parents out there. All right, I think we are good to go. Thank you all. Oh, one more message. Yep, perfect. Bye everybody.",Khanmigo Overview,"Khan Academy offers free educational courses and content, including math, that are accessible to students and educators.",00:02:00 - 00:03:00,2024-10-31T16:51:15Z,5210,57,1
Arizona: Meet Khan Academy & Khanmigo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39mIq44PXXY,"- Hi everyone. Welcome to our webinar
to discuss the good news. We officially have a partnership with ADE for this school year to
fund Khanmigo for students and it's broadly across
the state of Arizona. So if you are a member of a public school district in Arizona, you are in the right place. And as we wait for everyone to join, I'd love if you just wanna
go ahead and throw your name and your school district in the chat. I'll give you a second, we'll start to welcome everyone in and we are going to get kicking right off. All right, we'll take a peek while you're putting those
names in districts in the chat, we'll take a peek at our agenda. So we're gonna walk
through some introductions, Khanmigo overview and look at the Arizona
partnership specifics and then next steps in Q&A. But we have 45 minutes. It's definitely gonna be fast and furious and I want to make sure you
have everything you need to know leaving this session about the partnership with Khan Academy in Arizona. If you have questions
before the Q&A at the end, definitely feel free to
just throw them in the chat and our lovely team will
be here to assist you all and definitely get
those questions answered or we will have that time at the end. So let's kick it off
with some introductions. Speaking of that lovely team of ours, I'd like to introduce the Arizona team who will be supporting district partners with implementation
and training this year. First up, I'm myself. I'm Chelsea Hatchard,
Nice to meet you all. I support sales and outreach
to potential districts in the west and specifically Arizona. I previously was a sixth
grade math teacher myself and I'm based in Southern California. I'm now gonna pass it over to, do we have Jennifer on the line? - Yes, absolutely. Hi, I am Jennifer Cummings. I am the professional Learning Specialist for the Arizona team. I also am a former educator. I lived my life in junior high as the teacher and administrator and I am based in North central Texas. I am super excited for the opportunity to partner with you and your district and support Arizona teachers. Thank you so much for being here today - And we have Francis. - Good afternoon everybody. I'm Francis Barreto, I'll be supporting Arizona as
the District Success Manager. I am also in the north central Texas area and I'm very excited about partnering potentially
with all of you in Arizona. Thank you. - Alright, so for those of
you that may be familiar with Khan Academy already, and you know we've been
around for some time, you may be thinking, ""Wait, isn't Khan Academy already free?"" And yes, yes it is already free. Our mission is a free
world class education for anyone anywhere. So that means all that our courses and content that you
see here on the screen is already free to students and educators. And the best part is
you never have to choose which courses you wanna use, you get to use them all. I know we're often very
synonymous with math and that's kind of our roots of where we started with math videos. But as you can see, our courses have definitely
expanded over the years to now include everything from sciences, social studies, even
Khanmigo for educators, which is an awesome free course
to get teachers certified in how to use the teacher AI tools. And speaking of those teacher AI tools, those are actually free now as well. So in partnership with Microsoft, all of the teacher, 20 plus
teacher Khanmigo tools are free. So if you think lesson
planning, rubric generation, things for differentiation
and so much more, which we'll take a look at closer when we hop in live to the platform, but both our content and our courses as well as Khanmigo tools are already free now for you and district educators. So then the big kind of next question is, if it's at all that is already free, what is covered with the ADE partnership? Why do you need the ADE partnership? So Khanmigo courses, like I said, and Khanmigo teacher tools are free. This is a look at what I like to call the partnership difference, which highlights the benefits
of that paid partnership and and those components
that are covered now with the ADE partnership. So our district partnership includes, you can kind of see here, additional supports and services provided by our lovely Arizona team who you just met, Francis and Jennifer, and that's professional
development, implementation support. And these things we've
seen have been invaluable, especially with the implementation of AI and districts trying to
navigate what that looks like. So we've seen a lot of
success with districts who have been able to leverage
their supports and services. But then you also get additional things like auto rostering, scaled
up data and analytics, and then lastly the big
shiny exciting thing Khanmigo for students. So that is the AI student tutor component that's student facing instead of just the teacher facing tools. And all of this is now
made available to you at no cost as a partnership with ADE. So a lot of words to say a lot of things, but I'm gonna hop in
live to the platform now and be able to show you
guys a little bit about more about what I'm talking
about and take a peek. So let's switch gears here. All right, so you guys should all be able to see my screen now. And what you're looking at currently is all of our courses that we offer. So I showed you that
snapshot a second earlier, but we are definitely
expanded beyond math videos. You can see we definitely have
a depth of math content here, but also starting as in middle school and through high school we
have sciences, economics, arts and humanity courses. Financial literacy was a
new course that came out. AI for education and
Khanmigo for students. So they're able to kind
of explore AI literacy and what that looks like, and then a ton of partner
courses and additional resources. So you have all of this at
your fingertips already. Like I said, at risk would
sound like a broken record, it's free. And then you have those teacher tools. So these teacher tools also free. They have five kind of
general buckets here. So plan, create, differentiate,
support and learn. Your teachers can start using these today and they have the ability to
kind of sift through here. There's quite a lot here, 20 plus tools that teachers can use. So they have the ability
to favorite as well and if they wanted to
only view their favorites. So the ones that are kind
of committing to start using in the classroom now,
they can do that as well. And then there are some that
are more standalone activities. So I can come in and just
create a lesson plan, push that information in or create a discussion prompt for example. And then there are some
tools that are tied to our Khan Academy
courses like I showed you. So if you have students that are utilizing our Algebra One course or something of that nature, you have the ability to come in and get real time data and
analytics based on that. So I could look at my rostered class, my Algebra One students and then this is a class snapshot that gives me every seven days
kind of some digestible data about where my kids are at currently and how I can adjust or support
them from where they're at. So being able to really give some data informed instruction real time. You have the ability to click
in to even deeper reports and under your your teacher dashboard, teachers are able to see those reports. But this like I said,
is kind of a bite-size, super actionable every seven days. And so Khanmigo, the AI is
synthesizing all that data and then allowing you to
kind of get next steps and digest what students are working on. So I can see this whole snapshot here. Then if I wanted to, I can click into those deeper reports or it gives me some suggestions
of things I could next who should be celebrated for their work on their assignments this week. So I can ask who should be celebrated and it's gonna tell me who's
done really great work. In this case we're bad students, none of us have done our work. Who needs a check-in maybe
would be a better question for us demo students here today. But so it's gonna give you
those kind of action next steps. The other one that is tied to the work that students are doing is this recommended assignments. So if you click in here, you're able to see based on
what students are working on, where the skills are that they have, what Khanmigo recommends
that they do next. So you can select again
a course or a class that you have students set up in and then you're able to see
what the recommendations are for those next steps for them. Maybe it's videos, articles and exercise that they should work on based on kind of their skill level. So in this case it broke the students up into three different groups
based on how they're sitting and the recommendations of what that they should be working on based on their skills. Then I have the ability to
directly assign out from here. I can ask questions to Khanmigo
and kind of continue on. A last tool I'm gonna hop into and obviously there's a lot here and we could spend our whole time together digging into this. But the last tool I'm gonna click into is make it relevant. This one I think is
particularly fun for me because as a teacher,
I don't know about you. Like I said, I was a
sixth grade math teacher and the amount of times I
would try and find a topic that could make it
interesting or a lesson hook and I don't know, for
the longest time a ratio is always stuck out to
me because students, it always gave you cooking. It was like, ""Oh, how to bake a cake."" And I was like, ""Sixth graders
don't mind my sixth graders, at least maybe yours, don't care about baking cake."" So it wasn't the most relevant hook, but that's all I ever
found on the internet. So being able to say something like, I wanna calculate mean, median
and mode with my students, that's what I want them to be doing. That's the lesson that we're working on. But my students, you know, don't care about X, Y, and
Z that I think is cool. Maybe they care about soccer and that's like what matters to them. I can then in seconds at my fingertips have things that are relevant to my kids that are aligned to what I'm
trying to teach or introduce. And it didn't take me
all night researching, I know nothing about soccer. It didn't take me all night researching player performance stats
or things of that nature. I have it at my fingertips right now and it's gonna be relevant
and interesting to them. And we know that that
engagement piece is huge in getting them bought in. So, then you have this here. You're able to, you'll notice it looks
like a working document and that's very intentional. We want this to look
like a working document because we want the fingerprints
of the teacher on it. It's not meant to be something you just click and print and you're done. It's meant to save you time and be able to be able
to be more personalized and differentiated for those students. So now the teacher can come
in, they can ask questions, they can change things if they want. And then when they're ready, they can print, export,
do all of that good stuff. But you'll see here it
gave them a cool idea or for collecting scores
for soccer matches and being able to calculate based on the real team that they follow. So now that kid is excited, they got to watch the soccer game and that became their homework, right? Or that became a project
that they're working on. So that's one of my
personal favorite tools. But not only do you have teacher tools as kind of standalone activities, you also can utilize them within a course. So if I am... You're gonna see my bias
towards sixth grade math again. If I am in a course and I know I'm going to
be teaching unit one, Basic Ratios for my
students, it's coming up. I now have right here at
my fingertips up at the top the ability to create an
exit ticket from here, a lesson plan. So I could click in and
then create a lesson plan and it knows. Okay, this is the standards
that you're working on, this is the topic, go ahead and create that lesson plan. If I wanted to do it from my tool section, I'm able to. I would just have to push in the standard I'm looking at,
the learning objective I want and then it would be able to build it out the same way from there. So you kind of have optionality
in how you want to do that. But what you'll see here
it's super nice is that, comparatively to like going
on to maybe other platforms, ChatGPT in general and having to kind of build out a really kind of specific prompt. All I had to do was a standard, well all I had to do was
click in from a course. But even easier, you could just do a standard
or learning objective and now it already understands the flow and what a lesson plan should look like. It already has my learning
objective built in. My warmup, my direct instruction, right? I didn't have to give it a ton
of information for it to know what a solid lesson plan should look like. Then I have the ability while
I'm here to make adjustments. So if I want to do a different warmup, I don't wanna do a number talk, I can click in and ask it to change it, make some changes or
try something different. If I wanna include manipulatives. In this case it already did, but I could have said you know, I wanna include small groups or you know, I want to
have my exit tickets. I want an easy medium and hard exit ticket or mild, medium and spicy, right? So you can start to get creative there. You also can then ask for strategies to go along with your lessons. So can I have the strategies to go along with this lesson. So you can ask for
instructional resources. It understands kind of
common educational language and acronyms and things of that nature. It is kind of already
frontloaded with that. So it knows that's to support
English language learners. It's giving me ideas about visual aids or a specific sentence frame. The ratio of two is blank. And so it's kind of giving me tools that I can already start
to use and implement with this lesson. Couple other things I do wanna show you is now from the student side. So these are all teacher facing tools. Like I said, you already
have access to those today along with the courses. But part of that ADE partnership is really the the student
experience and the student tools. So let's hop in really quick. Let's go back to, go back
in sixth grade ratios here. And so as a teacher, I have that ability to kind of create some of those things there. As a student, I have the companion mode on the side or my little buddy on the side. I have student mode on here. It's gonna gimme some
dynamic action bubbles or some prompts to kind of get me started. This is a nice way to scaffold
for me if maybe I'm stuck and I don't really know what I don't know. I just know that I don't know the answer to this question, right? So it'll give me ones
like help me solve this or the classic age old, why should I care about
learning this my favorite. But you could click one of those. If I click help me solve this, it can start to work through this with me. You also have the ability
while it's thinking here, the ability to use text
to speech, speech to text. For math, you have the math
keys to be able to input, but it says sure, let's work through this together. How many total pieces of
fruit are in the bowl, right? I can say I can use classic taxi language, IDK, I don't know. I can be rather simple in my responses and it's gonna continue to
prompt and push me forward without giving away the answer. You'll notice it does
say calculating here. So we've added in a layer of calculator to support with the math accuracy. Says let's try adding numbers
of each of the fruit bowls. You have eight bananas,
five oranges, three apples. What do you get when
you add those together? If I say nope, just give me the answer. I don't wanna add the bowls, the fruit. spoiler alert, it should
not give me the answer. You shall see, drum roll. I can't give you the answer directly, but I can help you find it. Let's find out, Add the number of bananas together, right? So it's gonna continue to work with me. That's part of the guardrails
that are in place there to not give away the answer and to act as that good Socratic tutor. Some other guardrails to note, is if I were to say
something inappropriate, sexual, violent, things of that nature, we do have moderation flags. So that would be flagged and the the chat would be shut down. And we also, all the chats
are logged in viewable for both the student to
revisit and the teacher to see. Couple other things you do
have that I didn't mention. Preferences, you have the
ability to change the language. So it defaults to supporting in English, but it can in Spanish,
Hindi or Portuguese. And then you have the ability to change like the reading style
or level from simple, which is about second grade, standards, sixth, then Professorial is
that collegiate level. So some things that you can
do there in companion mode. But as a student, it doesn't have to only
be tied to the courses just like with those teacher tools. So if I'm using the courses
and I need help, amazing. If I'm watching a video or an article, it can summarize the video, quiz me on the video or article, things of that nature. But sometimes I'm using a textbook or I have a project that
I need help with, right? And it's not solely only
content I'm accessing through Khan Academy. So in that case your learner activities, they have kind of their own set of dashboard activities
that they can work through. Mainly the two popular ones here being Tutor me:Math and science
and Tutor me: Humanities. So those are our two kind of big buckets that students can bring information and push that information in. So think Tutor me:Math and science, maybe I have a test coming up or a word problem I'm stuck with or something from my textbook
that I need help with, and this is my place that I
can come and push that in. In this case, let's say
I have a test coming up, I can say give me five practice problems. It's gonna wanna know on what, right? So is it math, science,
things of that nature. So I could say math, maybe I am grade five,
multiplying fractions, right? And you'll see those
dynamic action bubbles continue to pop up and give them kind of
scaffolding and support, but you can always type
in whatever you want. Wonderful, now it's gonna
gimme five practice problems. Which one do I wanna start first? And I can start working
through that and getting help. If I have questions on
how to multiply fractions, I can start asking that. Maybe I don't understand the process and I can get help there. The other one Tutor me:Humanities, similar experience but for
those humanities things. So I can come and what's
nice about this is, we do have a lot of math and science content on our platform, but just because it's not on our platform doesn't mean Khanmigo can't support. So say ""Romeo and Juliet"", for example. We don't have the entire play of ""Romeo and Juliet"" on our site, but the AI can still support. So if I say I need help exploring themes of ""Romeo and Juliet"", but maybe I have to do a a project on it, write an essay, who knows? Awesome, it's rich in themes. Instead of just giving me
information right off the bat, let's explore what themes
have you noticed so far? So putting that onus backed on me, prompting and getting me engaged. Love and loss and I made a typo and it's gonna push right through that. Great, love and loss are essential themes. How do you see these themes
affecting the characters? So it's continuing to go
back and forth with me and I can continue to have
like that thought partner or brainstorm as I'm
exploring those themes. Another very exciting piece
on the humanities side is gonna be Writing Coach. So this is our newest iteration
of this is very exciting. There are some Khanmigo tools that are assignable which is awesome. So not only Writing Coach. but like chat with the
literary or historical figure. Those tutor me sections and a few others. Teachers can actually push out, so you can be able to
tailor that experience that you want students
to have with the AI. If you don't want them just having to come and put information in, maybe just as a way to
bring their questions, you could say, ""Hey, I want you to go to Ignite my curiosity
and it's an assignment out and I want you to explore
gene mutations and families. and then we're all gonna
share back what we learned or something of that nature."" So you do have some
control and flexibility to be able to push out assignments. Particularly with Writing Coach, this is one way you can do that. So you could assign an assignment
which is being an essay. You're able to put in the essay title, the grade level, the essay type, and then any essay instruction. So any parameters that
you have for the students, including a word count. Once you have that essay
type in or your essay in, you also will eventually receive reports. So you're able to see on that report if the students have started, what they've updated, the time they've spent, word count, any writing feedback they're getting And then an originality meter. Mainly our goal with Writing Coach is to be an instructional tool, not so much a grading tool and not so much like an AI sheet detector, but this originality meter
will let you know that like, ""Hey your students were
working on this essay and then all of a sudden copied and pasted the whole conclusion in."" So it will give you flags
for things like that. On the student side, if you pushed out that assignment, here's little demo essay, it would look like something like this. So they would start at understanding and the student's going to go ahead and get this essay prompt that the the teacher assigned out to them, has all the information
the teacher put in, those prompt instructions. And then what they have
which is really nice is throughout this entire writing process, they have this little buddy on the side, Khanmigo that's working through with them, making sure they understand
every step of the way and giving them real
time feedback and support so that you're not
completing a whole essay and then waiting two,
three, four weeks sometimes to get any feedback back on
that version of your essay. So here, this is the spot to make sure, ""Do you even understand
what I'm being asked to do?"" They ask them to explain the essay prompt. ""I don't know what a persuasive essay is. Can you explain that essay type to me?"" Sure it explains the essay type. Uses some language that
maybe I don't understand, what is a counter argument, right? So I'm able to walk through
and get support there. Once I feel good, I understand the essay prompt, I move into outlining. The lost art of outlining. I don't know about any of you, but in my days in school we would cut up pieces of paper
and you shifted it around. This is like the digital version of that where you can cut and move it around. It's flex a flexible outline to be able to add in all
the the body paragraphs, the evidence and all of that good stuff. But then again you still have
that Khanmigo on the side acting as a support. So are my sources done
properly in MLA format? I'm stuck. No worries, let's break
it down step by step. You already have a strong
thesis and some good points. Let's focus on refining and
reasoning and explanations. So it starts working with me. But if I ask something
again to the effect of like, give me the answer
right, give me a thesis, I can't provide you a thesis, but I can help you refine yours. I already had one in here so it's not gonna give
me a brand new thesis. Once I feel good about my outline, I move into that drafting phase. I have my outline on the side
to kind of pop things back in and then I head into revising. Now I have feedback in these kind of five general buckets here. In this case 19 pieces of feedback. Some are positive, your introduction clearly
states your stance on daylight savings time, good job, and then some are more constructive on things I can do to improve. So in this introduction
it could be even stronger if you considered
providing more background evidence or information. If I have questions on
that, I can then click in. Same thing if I have kind
of that conversation. It'll always give me
those prompts like I said. In this case it said,
""Do you want an example?"" Sure. So it gives me an example
not on daylight savings time, which I could then just copy
and paste into my own essay. It does one on left-handed
and right-handed people and it's a fascinating topic. Gives me a general intro and then one with more background to highlight what it's asking me to do. So that is kind of the
bulk of Writing Coach. And like I said, that's not the only kind
of standalone activity. There are quite a few others out here and a lot of these are even assignable. But without further ado, I think we're gonna pop back in. That was our fast and furious version of Khanmigo for students
and teacher tools. Thank you very much. So another thing, I loosely high alluded to
this in the demo there, but we do take data privacy and safe use of AI super seriously. And like I mentioned, teachers have access
to student chat history as well as receive moderation
flags for inappropriate chats. We don't use teacher and
student chats to train the model and no data information is
passed back to open to AI. Teachers also have the ability
to turn Khanmigo on and off. So during Khanmigo, when you're on Khan Academy if you're doing a quiz or a test, it already just won't appear. But if you're on the internet and you're taking a quiz or a test and then they have Khanmigo up, you can turn it off on focus
mode for up to four hours. And lastly, we've invested
in privacy, security and compliance measures for districts. So we have committed
to a Soc 2 Type audits, FERPA, COPPA compliant and compliant with all state
data privacy regulations. Now on to the good stuff. So hopefully by this point we are excited by the potential of what
Khanmigo can do for students in your district, in your classrooms. But let's talk nuts and bolts of the partnership
requirements for Arizona. So mainly you do need to
be a public school district or a public charter within Arizona. You need to be serving
grades five through 12. So this is focused in on
students grades five through 12. You need to have a minimum of
250 students in those grades. So if you're looking to target fifth, sixth, and seventh grade, you need to have 250
students within those grades or nine through 12,
something of that nature. You are able to partner
on grade level or school. So if you wanted to look
at across your district, all your sixth graders, or if you have an initiative to support ninth graders in math, right? So you can look at bucketing it that way. it doesn't have to be a
whole district partnership, it could be by grade level or by school as long as you're
hitting that 250 minimum. And then we do need clever or
class link for auto rostering. So that is how we roster
through those single sign-ons. So you will need one of those. And then the exciting stuff is, as I've already mentioned before, it's a 100% free of charge to you all. The partnership runs
through June 30th, 2025. So the end of this school year. There's no expectations on the DOE side of kind of implementation and
what it looks like for you. So however you're looking
and envision using this, there's no kind of mandates by Arizona. And then lastly, it is first come, first serve. So they have committed
to a 100,00 licenses broadly across Arizona and we are just giving those out first come first serve basis so that the sooner you
join us, the better. Speaking of joining us, we've already begun
onboarding and partnering with some awesome districts in Arizona and we can't wait to have you
be a part of that as well. You'll see a few listed here and there's even more to come. So I'm excited to continue partnering. Well that is, we're at about time. We have a few minutes left but I am going to be staying on, feel free to throw questions
in the chat please. But I wanted to thank you all
for joining the webinar today and I hope you found
this information valuable and are excited about the potential of partnering with Khan Academy and Khanmigo for your students. Yeah, and here's a few ways that whether you throw
questions in the chat now, but you can also email me directly at chelseahatchard@khanacademy.org, or you can visit the
blog that's linked here and that has all the
kind of nuts and bolts, everything you need to know
about the Arizona partnership. And then there's also
this QR code that scans and that sends all of your
information to me directly and I'm happy to reach out. So couple of ways to get in touch with me if that's what you're looking to do. Now, I don't know if there's, kick it over to the chat and
see if we have any questions. - Chelsea, there was a
question about private schools that was answered in the chat. I don't know if you wanna- - Yeah. Unfortunately, yeah. Private schools are not included. It is, if you're a public charter, that works but... - How could Khanmigo support career and technical education programs? - We do. I mean there's a ton of courses on there that you could take a peek at and see if there's anything that kind
of meets your specific needs and I'd be happy to discuss further. Jennifer, do you have any, or I mean either, Francis, do you have anything to add to that in terms of specifically supporting career and technical education programs? - I just would add that
that our coursework under the life skills as well as just preparing for SAT and additional college and
career readiness opportunities, those are all courses that are available. And Khanmigo, the
student side of Khanmigo, there's actually some learner activities that are built in specifically for college admissions, college essays, even doing research on potential careers. And so there are definitely
places that could, you could infuse the learner activities for specific career and
technical education programming. Yes, and Francis just added computing courses for
programming and Python as well. So those are all additional things and as Chelsea pointed out, all of those courses are available through the partnership and they're free. So if you aren't able to partner with us for whatever reason, those courses are also available. - Marnie, great question. I will clarify. So what is already free
is Khan Academy courses and teacher tools. What is not free is Khanmigo for students. So that any AI Khanmigo tools
that are student facing. So I just showed you Writing
Coach, the Companion Mode, Tutor me:Math and science,
Tutor me:Humanities, all of that stuff. Anything student facing
Khanmigo is not free and Arizona, DOE is
footing the bill for that and covering that partnership. So it's free to you in
partnership with us, but it is not typically free. So that is the real benefit there and then you're also getting
supports and services. So the lovely help of
Jennifer and Francis, which I guess that is invaluable in terms of AI specifically, the biggest piece of feedback
I think we've received is even from teachers
is that rolling this out so much more successful when you have a professional development and an implementation
specialist supporting. 'Cause it is so new and especially the time
we are in the year, right? Implementing mid-year is kind of hard, so making sure teachers feel supported and have kind of all
the tools that they need to be successful with
rolling this out to kids. School under 250 could participate. At this time I can send
you over some free tools for schools under 250, but at this time unfortunately, the the formal partnership no, but we could get you some
resources to support. If you want to email me, Tina and I would be happy to
send you over what I have. Oh yeah, and Francis sorry to your point, you do get scaled update and analytics for the paid partnership. So essentially the free
version is like teachers and the paid version is a district, right? So now the principals have
lines of site into how the school is doing, the
curriculum directors, right? You have more scaled update and analytics in a more macro view
versus the free version, is just mainly teacher tools. - There is also a really
great teacher tool that comes with that data reporting that the free version does
not allow for class snapshot. And so thinking about the amount of time that teachers spend trying
to disaggregate data, extrapolate and pull from
multiple different places, there is one tool that
with a click of a button it can give you a seven day overview of how your students are performing and that is part of the
paid partnership as well. - And Tina, to your point
for the umbrella of schools. If you guys are all on the same like clever or class link instance, that's something we could explore. But if they're all
individually like rostered, then it looks a little different. Absolutely, if you have no more questions, feel free to leave. And thank you so much. We're hanging around for
another couple minutes just to if there's any other questions. But again, thank you for your time. If you're interested in learning more or moving forward with partnership, feel free to email me or scan
that QR code like we said. Yes, my email is in the chat and the Jennifer maybe can throw
that link back in, perfect. - There is the link, absolutely. - Thank you all so much
and happy Halloween almost. We have Halloween tomorrow, I don't know about any of you. Taking my one-year-old who is protesting, dressing up like mini mouse out. So good luck to all of
those parents out there. All right, I think we are good to go. Thank you all. Oh, one more message. Yep, perfect. Bye everybody.",Arizona Partnership Specifics,"The Khanmigo partnership in Arizona is supported by the Arizona team, which includes Chelsea Hatchard (Sales and Outreach), Jennifer Cummings (Professional Learning Specialist), and Francis Barreto (District Success Manager), who will provide implementation support and training to district partners.",00:03:00 - 00:05:00,2024-10-31T16:51:15Z,5210,57,1
College and Khan Academy: District-wide Strategies for SAT Prep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN2ABy7xSEA,"- As we continue to admit folks, we wanna remind everyone that today's session is being recorded. Feel free to add your
questions in the chat. We have a host of Khan Academy folks ready to answer your
questions in real time. We are thrilled to have you join us as we explore an exciting
partnership between Khan Academy and the College Board. This collaboration signifies
a groundbreaking step forward in educational support and resources, specifically designed to
enhance student success. Today we'll delve into the unique benefits of the Khan Academy District
Partnership Program, which offers schools access
to a comprehensive suite of resources tailored to
improve SAT preparation and overall academic performance. Our goal is to equip educators and students with vetted high
quality practice materials that not only boost test scores, but also positively
impact graduation rates across partnering school districts. As we navigate through the
details of this partnership, you'll learn how Khan
Academy's innovative approach to personalized learning
can empower students, providing them with the tools
they need to improve outcomes on the digital SAT. We'll share insights, success stories, and practical implementation strategies that will help you understand how this partnership can be a game changer for your district. So sit back and prepare to discover the transformative potential of the Khan Academy and
College Board partnership. My name is Jamie Grant, and
I'll be your host for today. For 20 years, I was a science
teacher in both public and independent schools. Beginning my journey into the classroom after having completed the
DC Teaching Fellows program. During my time as a K-12 educator, I served as a department
chairperson, class sponsor, teacher trainer, advisor, and mentor. But since leaving the classroom,
I've served in the capacity of a senior customer success manager, grant program directorate, and currently as a district
partnerships manager for the southeast region. It is my pleasure to introduce to you our speakers for today,
Diona Clingman, Sarah Thaler, both from Khan Academy, as well as Maureen Foreman
from the College Board. So with that, we're going
to ask them a few questions and chat more about the
partnership between Khan Academy and College Board. Sarah, Sarah Thaler brings a wealth of information and
experience to our session. She spent her early career as
a high school science teacher and building administrator. Then transitioned to the College Board where she dedicated eight years to enhancing educational assessments, culminating in her role
as the Senior Director of Institutional Assessment Management. Currently, Sarah serves
as a Success Manager at Khan Academy, where she collaborates with districts and higher
education institutions to facilitate the
successful implementation of Khan Academy and Khanmigo. Her expertise will illuminate the benefits of our partnership and show
how it can positively impact students across our districts. Welcome Sarah. Maureen Foreman is Vice President of SAT Suite Program and
Innovation at College Board. She began her career as a
teacher in Philadelphia, with the New Teacher Project, and she was a Teach for America mentor. Maureen, can you tell us
about College Board's mission and what inspires you to
do your work every day? - Thanks, Jamie. So College Board's mission ultimately is to connect students with
post-secondary opportunities in college and career. Our goal is to make sure
that students understand a bit more about themselves, what they know and what they don't know, and how we can support
them in their journey toward their best fit
path after high school. As you mentioned, I am
also a former educator, and so there's a lot of
synergy between College Board and Khan Academy's mission
to connect students with those opportunities. In the SAT Suite, the core of what we do helps students understand
the knowledge and skills that they are learning in high school every step of the way. When we think about our connection
to students and families, we also think about
scholarship opportunities and the doors that we unlock to potential future opportunities. We're all about connecting
students to that next step on their path to learning and to growth. And I think at the end of the day, as people together who are in education and in support of students
as learners and educators as people sort of shepherding young minds, That is really what drives us forward and connects our work together. - [Jamie] Thanks, Maureen. Sarah, what can you tell us
about Khan Academy's mission and how your work on SAT
connects to that vision? - Thanks Jamie. Khan Academy's mission
is to provide a free world class education to anyone, anywhere, and with our partnership
with College Board, any student could create
a Khan Academy account and access those digital SAT prep courses completely for free. This obviously eliminates the
barriers of costly SAT prep, it's for everyone, not just
for those who can afford it. And it's fantastic, a great
opportunity for students to have this opportunity, but the administrators
you're kind of blind into their progress and how they're using this SAT prep courses. So this is where really the power of Khan Academy partnership comes in. You can get valuable
insights into the skills that students are working on. You get administrator analytics, access to professional learning, support with rostering, access to a district success
manager that can help you with your implementation. Also, you could potentially
have access to Khanmigo. Which is our one-to-one
personal tutor for students and a teacher assistant
for all of your teachers. This allows you to be more supportive and more intentional
in how you are helping your students prepare for the SAT. - [Jamie] Thank you so much,
Sarah. Going back to Maureen. Maureen, can you tell us about how the partnership came to be? - Yes, so we are, if you can believe it, about to celebrate our 10
year anniversary together as partners. Through this nearly
decade long partnership. We've learned a lot about ourselves, our respective organizations, and the way we most effectively
work for and with students. The reason that we sort of
embarked on this partnership back in the day is we really
believe that it is our role to clear path for all students to have access to free, high quality, continuously improving test prep that can be utilized in a variety of ways, whether that's to an individual
learner on their own, for a student who's working with a tutor or other support within their school, or maybe most effectively
and most importantly, integrated into their classroom experience with the teachers and educators
who are supporting students to and through their knowledge that are really assessed on the SAT. We think about the SAT, it
is essentially an assessment of the core knowledge
and skills that students are developing and sort of growing in their courses across high school. So whether that's in
math courses or reading and writing courses, each of those skills really build upon themselves. So year over year students
are in their classes building those knowledge and skills that are assessed on the SAT. The digital SAT really
measures what matters and practice makes progress, right? So by having our partnership
with Khan Academy so widely available to
individual students, we also know that supporting
educators with the use of that tool in the classroom
really moves the needle when it comes to how students
understand the knowledge and skills that are assessed on the test, the type of items that help
to assess their knowledge, and really the way that students do that with the caring
adults in their lives, whether those are, again,
parents, tutors, educators. That can look really different
in terms of a support system for students. And Khan Academy really helps
us to scale the knowledge and expertise that students
will need to be successful, not just on the test, but
ultimately in connecting them to those resources supports
for college career and beyond. And so to me, what
really inspires the work that we do together is how
we think about the learner at the center of everything we do. Some of the features that
I love about Khan Academy in general, but specifically
in the digital SAT course, is it helps students move
through foundation all the way up through mastery of the
knowledge and skills assessed on the SAT. We've built this partnership
by leveraging the items that are written by the makers of the SAT, so authored by College Board
shared with Khan Academy. And then Khan Academy
really helps us to scale sort of explanations
of knowledge and skills that help students refresh their knowledge of what they've already
learned in certain classes, and then to see that grow
through foundation's, advanced mastery level learning in their Khan Academy courses. So as you've heard on this call, many of us come from a
background in education. We really think about
how do we meet students where they are and how do we help them sort of track their progress
and really grow that knowledge over time. So whether that's through
refreshing knowledge skills or sometimes really learning
them for the first time or learning them in a
different way, there's so much that Khan Academy does to help
meet students where they are. And to help educators really
differentiate their instruction and tailor their work with students through those knowledge and skills. We've had tremendous impact
through official SAT practice, which was the original course that helped to support students through
the paper pencil version of the SAT. And now together in the digital space where our digital natives truly are, we're really thinking differently about how we more meaningfully make space for those connections in a
variety of different ways with educators, through our
partnerships, with states, with districts, and
with individual schools and educators themselves. Whether that's through a coaching model or whether that's through a
strategic district-wide adoption of Khan Academy for districts,
or even thinking about where Khanmigo has a place for students in really personalizing
and tailoring instruction and helping students grow the knowledge and skills that are assessed on the SAT. We just see tremendous growth potential from where we are today,
building on that strong, nearly decades long foundation together and our continued
commitment to evolving that and growing those supports
for and with students and in service of schools,
districts and parents. - [Jamie] Thank you so much.
That was incredibly insightful. Turning back to Sarah, in your time, working across both orgs, what's your perspective
on how the partnership has evolved over time? - So I do remember starting
out at College Board about nine years ago when this partnership was beginning to launch. And I remember being really
excited to talk to districts about this free official SAT practice. And as Maureen said, that's when it was called
back then is SAT practice because Khan Academy had the content but also had practice
materials on our site. And as College Board
transitions to digital testing, the practice tests and practice
experience is now available in Blue Book, College Board's
digital testing application. And then that's important because
it gives students a chance to get comfortable with a platform that they're actually gonna
be taking the test on. And our focus at Kahn Academy
has shifted to SAT prep and it's just not the
test preppy type of things like test taking strategies and time management study skills. We obviously cover that
and that's super important. But really the powerful impact is the high quality course content that has been created
along with College Board. It's mastery enabled,
like our other courses are within the platform. And it truly assesses or
it covers what is assessed on the SAT. - [Jamie] Thank you so much Sarah. Maureen, what are you proud
of when you think about the partnership? - Honestly, I'm really proud
of the work we've done together and the way that we put
the learner at the center of everything that we do. So whether that's thinking about how students are receiving
their digital SAT prep course that could be sort of
on their mobile device. Right we are as digital natives where they have access to,
maybe it's just their phone, maybe it's something they're
doing on a school bus. It's the universal access
to digital SAT prep in many different spaces
through the classroom, on their own, but
connecting them to a coach that can really help support that journey becomes even more important to us as we think about students
that are taking SAT school day, PSAT and MSQT. That growth over time and each of those sort of assessment moments as
benchmarking their progress towards showing what they know on test day and unlocking those future opportunities for and with students. What I think about the
millions of learners that we connect to these
supports and to educators, helping them understand
where their students are, and where they need to go and grow next, that really inspires my work and how we think about growing the course in service of students. So whether that's through
adding additional content together, going to a next level of detail through the videos,
articles, worked examples that help students really understand the underlying knowledge and skills that they will build
upon as they move through each of the foundational steps of understanding the knowledge and skills assessed on the SAT
with the types of items that they will experience in Blue Book, our digital testing application. There's so much work that we do together to build familiarity with the platform students will utilize on test day, but even how to navigate the tools that they will experience. A great example of this
is getting familiar with the Desmos calculator
that students will use on test day. Knowing how to best leverage that tool that all students have access to. Is really an incredible
piece of our work together. And I think at the end of the day, what we're all trying to achieve is fully integrating
students understanding of the types of questions, items that students will
experience on test day in the moments where
they're actually learning those knowledge and
skills in the classroom. And to me, that integration
is what's going to really help students understand that
the SAT isn't something that happens at the end of high school. It's not just in service
of college entrance. It's really an assessment that's designed to help students show what they know and what they've learned
all throughout high school and together by both connecting students with the online course itself, but actually the educators
who are helping them attain those knowledge and skills
throughout high school. That to me is the power of
our connection together, our reach and our ability to
make meaningful impact at scale for all students. - [Jamie] Thank you so much Maureen. We're gonna shift to Sarah, who's our District Success Manager. And so can you speak to the
support that you provide to districts related to digital SAT prep? - Yeah, so part of what I do is I can act as a thought partner with you. We know that every school
has different circumstances and we can provide guidance and resources to support a variety of
implementation models. Your district may have
designated SAT prep courses that students are required or
elected to take for instance. Or your district may have advisory or seminar win times
where you want to engage with SAT prep. And Avi, if you could share
the screen back again. There we go. And the
next one, there we go. So lots of different
ways to implement SAT. As I mentioned, designated
SAT prep courses, advisory seminar times. We could also talk to you
if you have an afterschool or summer school program and you want to utilize SAT prep there. Maybe you aren't able to
designate specific times and you need to embed SAT
prep into your core classes. We can help with those strategies. And then you could also
have supportive parents that want to help their students engage with the digital SAT prep classes at home. It is important to engage
students, keep them motivated, so we have resources such as data trackers that students can use to
monitor their own short and long-term goals. Finally, some of our districts
strategically think about four year plans for SAT prep. That use a combination
of our SAT prep courses along with our other course content. One of our district partners with a four year
implementation success plan is the school district of
Osceola County in Florida. Osceola has about 70,000
students in over 80 schools who speak about a 100 different languages. And the district sets
expectations that students are to use Khan Academy
for 30 minutes a week and to level up two skills per week in grades nine through 12. Every school has the autonomy
for how they want students to get this time, but their
fidelity of implementation and creating a culture of expectation has really led to student success with their graduation rate being
at an all time high of 91%. Osceola attributes,
the use of Khan Academy to much of the success, we
have a blog post on our website if you wanna learn more
about their implementation. Another success story is Garland in Texas. Garland ISD has over 51,000 students they're are outside the Dallas area. Garland administrators emphasized
the use of Khan Academy six weeks prior to students taking the SAT and they expect students
to use Khan Academy for 30 minutes a week. The great thing about Garland is that they did their own
analysis of students PSAT/NMSQT and SAT test scores. And correlated that to the amount of time that they spent within the platform. They looked at students' scores when they took the PSAT/NMSQT in the fall of their 10th grade year, so the fall of their 11th grade year. This comparison is shown
in the first set of columns on the chart. Then they looked at their
The PSAT/NMSQT from the fall of their junior year to the SAT in the spring of their junior year, which is that second set of columns. As you can see in the charts, all students did improve
their test scores, but students who used Khan Academy for more than a 100
minutes had statistically significant higher scores than
students who spent less time. Now I'd like to pivot to
talk about one of the reasons why these districts had so much success using the SAT prep courses. And that's really due to how
the courses are structured. College Board makes it known
what is assessed on the SAT. It's not a secret. They publish an assessment framework, you can find it on their website. And within the reading
and writing section, students are assessed in
four different domains. Information and ideas,
craft and structure, expression of ideas, and
standard English conventions. And on the right is a screenshot of the SAT prep course in Khan Academy, and you can see how these
units align to those domains. You can also see that there
are foundational units, there are medium units,
there are advanced units, so that we're scaffolding all
of these skills for students to provide additional support. The math course is
structured in the same way. There's also four domains
assessed on the SAT math section, the algebra, advanced math,
geometry, and trigonometry, and problem solving and data analysis. The units are again, scaffolded
with increasing difficulty and aligned to those
domains being assessed. And then we can go even
deeper into the structure of the assessment and the courses. Because the courses
review all of the skills that are on the SAT. And as Maureen mentioned, these
skills are enduring skills that students are learning
in their classroom. And so, for example, in the
information and ideas domain, one of the skills assessed
is command of evidence. And within the screenshot
there you will see that command of evidence
and all of the skills assessed on the SAT are
embedded within our courses. And this is really important because knowing that all of the skills that are assessed on the
SAT are in the prep courses. It's extremely powerful
and impactful for students who are preparing to take the SAT. Diona's gonna show you how
all of this is demonstrated in our platform. So Jamie, I'll let you introduce Diona. - All right, so Diona Clingman
is an experienced educator with over 20 years in the field, hailing from Flint, Michigan. She has served in various roles
including classroom teacher, director of academics, and principal. Diona is skilled in using AI for SAT prep, and she is passionate about fostering a positive learning environment
while empowering students and educators alike. - Well, hello everyone and thank you Jamie for that introduction. So now on the screen, what
you see is the landing page of what your students will see when they begin working in
the digital SAT courses. So kind of thinking about
kind of what Sarah just said previously about how they're aligned, now we're gonna look at how
these courses are formatted. Each one of these
courses, as she mentioned, are broken down into units. And within these units,
students now have access to some learning tools,
articles, and videos that help break down some
of those key concepts that may be hard for them. And so they can watch a video,
they can read an article. Students can also practice their learning through practice exercises. They can also take quizzes
as well as unit test. Now, once a student begins
working in the platform, one way that they can kind
of ma track how they're doing is through this section here, which is our mastery dashboard. Now on this mastery dashboard, students in real time will get feedback on how they're doing on
each one of these skills. Based on our four mastery levels, our four mastery levels
are attempted, familiar, proficient, and mastered. And so this allows
students to be able to see what are those areas that
I still need to work on. Or what are those areas
that I'm okay, you know, that I'm mastering. The goal for all of your
students will be for them to get into this purple area,
this proficient and mastered. Now this along with the
ability for teachers to track student progress
is all available free on our platform, but I'm a
former building principal, so I know the ability to look at analytics for my building and look
at data is very important. So now let me show you that if you partner with Khan Academy, how
you'll be able to have access to this data and leverage it. You'll be able to get to
your administrator dashboard by clicking on your name. And you'll see that there is a option for you to go to your
administrator dashboard. Now when you go into
this wide array of data, you're gonna see very high
level on this landing page, how your district or your school is doing. Now, if you are a building principal, you're only gonna have
access to your data. But if you are a district
level administrator, you'll be able to see all the schools that are in your specific district. When you look at the landing page, you're gonna see very high level. You'll be able to track the activation of your students and teachers. You'll be able to see are your student, how are your students
doing when it comes to them getting in that purple area
were just talking about. How many of those skills
are in that proficient or master area. You can also track Khanmigo usage, our AI tool that was kind
of mentioned earlier. You can track learning minutes. How many minutes are the
students in your school or your district. How much time are they
spending within the platform? And then you can also
see skills leveled up. So are they improving going
from that attempted to familiar or even familiar to proficient. Now on the left hand side,
along with that assistance as well from your
district support manager, that will help you kind of be
able to interpret this data. On the left hand side,
you're able to drill down a little bit more into your data. So over here, when we look at
activation, if I drill down, I can see that I can monitor
activation by school, I can do it by grades. I can also do it by teacher. So for example, if I
wanna look at my teachers. Here, I'm able to see all of my teachers, I'm able to see if their
accounts are activated, the number of students
that are rostered to them, and then whether or not
their students have activated their accounts as well
as started an activity. So this is just a great way to find out who are those teachers that
need that little bit of support with getting started, getting
the students on the platform and you know, getting
them started in utilizing that digital SAT content. Now once everybody's
accounts are activated and I see that students
accounts are activated, then the next thing I may
wanna start looking at is progress, how are we doing, right? So then when I go over here to progress, and if I drill down, now I'm able to see a
couple different options. I can see it by course,
I can see it by school, I can see it by grades,
teachers, and even skills. So if I wanted to start
looking at how are, you know, how are the students doing
in the digital SAT courses, I can click on courses. And now I'm brought to, what is it called? Our progress by course report. Here I can filter by specific
date range, my school, my grades, and then I
can also just scroll down and find my digital SAT. And then I'm now able to
see just how they're doing on those specific courses. Now here it is kind of telling
me how my students are doing and how much time they're
spending in the platform. So here I see, here's my
digital SAT math course. I see the number of students
that are in this course, and once your teacher's a part of their professional development, they'll be trained on
how to add this course so that you as the administrator can start tracking progress. And so here it shows me
the number of students that are in this course,
their learning minutes. How are they spending time
within this timeframe? How many skills did they work on? The average number of
skills they worked on within this timeframe. And then did they level up? Did they go from that
attempted to familiar, or familiar to proficient? And then also I'm able to
track how many of those skills landed in that purple. I can also drill down
and look at it by school. And then within my school, start looking at those specific teachers. And then from those specific teachers, I can also look at specific students. So if you have a teacher come to and say, you know, Diona's having a hard time in her digital SAT math course with, you know, with leveling up, this is the way you can start. You know, you'll have your own set of data to be able to look at Diona. And then say, okay, this
is how you know this is... And start that conversation
with your teacher and see how the two of
you can work together to support your student. You also have the ability
to monitor Khanmigo usage. So you can look at usage
as well as activity. So in a world where your
students are utilizing Khanmigo in that digital SAT course,
because you know they're stuck and they need that extra support, we can go here to activity. Now here I can see what
activities my students are using Khanmigo on. And when I go here with them
using it with an exercise, I can drill down and when I
drill down I can see the course. And here's my digital SAT math course. And so when I drill down
here, now I'm able to even see what specific units they worked on, as well as the number of students
who utilize this as well. So if I see that I have a lot
of students using it, great. If I see I have a small
number of students using it, then that can be a
conversation maybe in a PLC or with my teachers around
how can we increase this usage or what is the root cause
as to how our students are having issues with utilizing Khanmigo. Also, on your admin dashboard, you do have access to resources, everything from our Khan
Academy Administrator guide, which is a step by step
guide that will guide you through not only navigating the platform, but also how to read
these reports as well. And then we also have our
Khan for Educators course. These are very detailed videos in which we show you kind of step by step how to have a successful
implementation as well. And now we're going to also begin, Jamie's gonna talk to
you a little bit about how you can use AI for SAT prep. - Thank you so much, Diona. Let me just go ahead and share my screen. All right, so I am gonna show
you the student experience using Khanmigo, which is
an on-demand student tutor, available 24/7 specifically
for SAT preparation when used in conjunction with the Khan Academy SAT Resources. So on my screen you can
see the Explore Foundations in algebra course on the
digital SAT suite of courses. We see, like, you know,
other Khan Academy courses, progression is rooted in mastery and this is something Diona
showed you a few minutes ago. We also see that, you know,
when we hit the start button, we see that students
experience the familiar feel of all the other Khan Academy courses. And so if we go ahead and
get started with a question, we see that Khanmigo is there, right there to help students
work through exercises should they need assistance. And so what's really nice
is that students can begin a session simply by using a
prompt bubble or by typing or speaking their question
into the designated area. So from the teacher's perspective, Khanmigo is their version
of receiving assistance through teacher tools, which include things like lesson planning, receiving a class snapshot, and through getting a list
of recommended assignments. So by utilizing those teacher tools. I'm so sorry, by utilizing
those teacher tools, teachers can get assistance
with progress on SAT prep, group students based on recent work and help meet students'
needs in less time. Now, safety and privacy are paramount. We are committed to
ensuring that kids are safe and their information is private. With the Khanmigo partnership, teachers and administrators
have full visibility into everything that
students are working on and chatting about. Our guardrails ensure
that students are safe and monitored at all times. In addition, the Socratic
method of questioning by Khanmigo ensures that
students think deeply during their SAT practice without ever getting the answers directly. As we near the end of this webinar, we wanted to highlight the
district partnership difference. As most of you know, many
of Khan Academy's resources and tools are free. Khan Academy houses the
only SAT prep course created in partnership with College Board. On our platform, visitors have access to all standards aligned courses, including the digital SAT course, progress monitoring
and growth on SAT prep. And teachers can create
targeted assignments as needed. As mentioned before, practice test scores from the College Board Blue
Book app prompts students to visit Khan Academy to
practice skill improvement. As part of a district partnership. Our partners benefit from
automated seamless rostering, administrator reporting,
professional learning for teachers and administrators, a
district success manager, and access to our AI
student tutor Khanmigo. As a reminder, our teacher tools are free, but our district partners receive access to our enterprise Khanmigo tools. Last but not least, we'd
like to introduce you to our district partnerships team. Danielle Sullivan covers
our Northeast Territory. Renee Venegas, myself and
Mark Jamison cover our south and southeast regions. Jason Feig spearheads
partnerships in the Midwest. Jason Hovey and Chelsea Hatchard together cover the Western region
of the United States. With that, if you are interested
in a district partnership with Khan Academy, scan this QR code, which will put you in touch
with our district's team. As a reminder, participants
who RSVP'd to this event, will have access to the video recording. Thank you for joining us today, and a special thank you to
Maureen Forman for joining us. We are eternally grateful for your time and the continued
collaboration and partnership between College Board and Khan Academy.

College and Khan Academy: District-wide Strategies for SAT Prep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN2ABy7xSEA,"- As we continue to admit folks, we wanna remind everyone that today's session is being recorded. Feel free to add your
questions in the chat. We have a host of Khan Academy folks ready to answer your
questions in real time. We are thrilled to have you join us as we explore an exciting
partnership between Khan Academy and the College Board. This collaboration signifies
a groundbreaking step forward in educational support and resources, specifically designed to
enhance student success. Today we'll delve into the unique benefits of the Khan Academy District
Partnership Program, which offers schools access
to a comprehensive suite of resources tailored to
improve SAT preparation and overall academic performance. Our goal is to equip educators and students with vetted high
quality practice materials that not only boost test scores, but also positively
impact graduation rates across partnering school districts. As we navigate through the
details of this partnership, you'll learn how Khan
Academy's innovative approach to personalized learning
can empower students, providing them with the tools
they need to improve outcomes on the digital SAT. We'll share insights, success stories, and practical implementation strategies that will help you understand how this partnership can be a game changer for your district. So sit back and prepare to discover the transformative potential of the Khan Academy and
College Board partnership. My name is Jamie Grant, and
I'll be your host for today. For 20 years, I was a science
teacher in both public and independent schools. Beginning my journey into the classroom after having completed the
DC Teaching Fellows program. During my time as a K-12 educator, I served as a department
chairperson, class sponsor, teacher trainer, advisor, and mentor. But since leaving the classroom,
I've served in the capacity of a senior customer success manager, grant program directorate, and currently as a district
partnerships manager for the southeast region. It is my pleasure to introduce to you our speakers for today,
Diona Clingman, Sarah Thaler, both from Khan Academy, as well as Maureen Foreman
from the College Board. So with that, we're going
to ask them a few questions and chat more about the
partnership between Khan Academy and College Board. Sarah, Sarah Thaler brings a wealth of information and
experience to our session. She spent her early career as
a high school science teacher and building administrator. Then transitioned to the College Board where she dedicated eight years to enhancing educational assessments, culminating in her role
as the Senior Director of Institutional Assessment Management. Currently, Sarah serves
as a Success Manager at Khan Academy, where she collaborates with districts and higher
education institutions to facilitate the
successful implementation of Khan Academy and Khanmigo. Her expertise will illuminate the benefits of our partnership and show
how it can positively impact students across our districts. Welcome Sarah. Maureen Foreman is Vice President of SAT Suite Program and
Innovation at College Board. She began her career as a
teacher in Philadelphia, with the New Teacher Project, and she was a Teach for America mentor. Maureen, can you tell us
about College Board's mission and what inspires you to
do your work every day? - Thanks, Jamie. So College Board's mission ultimately is to connect students with
post-secondary opportunities in college and career. Our goal is to make sure
that students understand a bit more about themselves, what they know and what they don't know, and how we can support
them in their journey toward their best fit
path after high school. As you mentioned, I am
also a former educator, and so there's a lot of
synergy between College Board and Khan Academy's mission
to connect students with those opportunities. In the SAT Suite, the core of what we do helps students understand
the knowledge and skills that they are learning in high school every step of the way. When we think about our connection
to students and families, we also think about
scholarship opportunities and the doors that we unlock to potential future opportunities. We're all about connecting
students to that next step on their path to learning and to growth. And I think at the end of the day, as people together who are in education and in support of students
as learners and educators as people sort of shepherding young minds, That is really what drives us forward and connects our work together. - [Jamie] Thanks, Maureen. Sarah, what can you tell us
about Khan Academy's mission and how your work on SAT
connects to that vision? - Thanks Jamie. Khan Academy's mission
is to provide a free world class education to anyone, anywhere, and with our partnership
with College Board, any student could create
a Khan Academy account and access those digital SAT prep courses completely for free. This obviously eliminates the
barriers of costly SAT prep, it's for everyone, not just
for those who can afford it. And it's fantastic, a great
opportunity for students to have this opportunity, but the administrators
you're kind of blind into their progress and how they're using this SAT prep courses. So this is where really the power of Khan Academy partnership comes in. You can get valuable
insights into the skills that students are working on. You get administrator analytics, access to professional learning, support with rostering, access to a district success
manager that can help you with your implementation. Also, you could potentially
have access to Khanmigo. Which is our one-to-one
personal tutor for students and a teacher assistant
for all of your teachers. This allows you to be more supportive and more intentional
in how you are helping your students prepare for the SAT. - [Jamie] Thank you so much,
Sarah. Going back to Maureen. Maureen, can you tell us about how the partnership came to be? - Yes, so we are, if you can believe it, about to celebrate our 10
year anniversary together as partners. Through this nearly
decade long partnership. We've learned a lot about ourselves, our respective organizations, and the way we most effectively
work for and with students. The reason that we sort of
embarked on this partnership back in the day is we really
believe that it is our role to clear path for all students to have access to free, high quality, continuously improving test prep that can be utilized in a variety of ways, whether that's to an individual
learner on their own, for a student who's working with a tutor or other support within their school, or maybe most effectively
and most importantly, integrated into their classroom experience with the teachers and educators
who are supporting students to and through their knowledge that are really assessed on the SAT. We think about the SAT, it
is essentially an assessment of the core knowledge
and skills that students are developing and sort of growing in their courses across high school. So whether that's in
math courses or reading and writing courses, each of those skills really build upon themselves. So year over year students
are in their classes building those knowledge and skills that are assessed on the SAT. The digital SAT really
measures what matters and practice makes progress, right? So by having our partnership
with Khan Academy so widely available to
individual students, we also know that supporting
educators with the use of that tool in the classroom
really moves the needle when it comes to how students
understand the knowledge and skills that are assessed on the test, the type of items that help
to assess their knowledge, and really the way that students do that with the caring
adults in their lives, whether those are, again,
parents, tutors, educators. That can look really different
in terms of a support system for students. And Khan Academy really helps
us to scale the knowledge and expertise that students
will need to be successful, not just on the test, but
ultimately in connecting them to those resources supports
for college career and beyond. And so to me, what
really inspires the work that we do together is how
we think about the learner at the center of everything we do. Some of the features that
I love about Khan Academy in general, but specifically
in the digital SAT course, is it helps students move
through foundation all the way up through mastery of the
knowledge and skills assessed on the SAT. We've built this partnership
by leveraging the items that are written by the makers of the SAT, so authored by College Board
shared with Khan Academy. And then Khan Academy
really helps us to scale sort of explanations
of knowledge and skills that help students refresh their knowledge of what they've already
learned in certain classes, and then to see that grow
through foundation's, advanced mastery level learning in their Khan Academy courses. So as you've heard on this call, many of us come from a
background in education. We really think about
how do we meet students where they are and how do we help them sort of track their progress
and really grow that knowledge over time. So whether that's through
refreshing knowledge skills or sometimes really learning
them for the first time or learning them in a
different way, there's so much that Khan Academy does to help
meet students where they are. And to help educators really
differentiate their instruction and tailor their work with students through those knowledge and skills. We've had tremendous impact
through official SAT practice, which was the original course that helped to support students through
the paper pencil version of the SAT. And now together in the digital space where our digital natives truly are, we're really thinking differently about how we more meaningfully make space for those connections in a
variety of different ways with educators, through our
partnerships, with states, with districts, and
with individual schools and educators themselves. Whether that's through a coaching model or whether that's through a
strategic district-wide adoption of Khan Academy for districts,
or even thinking about where Khanmigo has a place for students in really personalizing
and tailoring instruction and helping students grow the knowledge and skills that are assessed on the SAT. We just see tremendous growth potential from where we are today,
building on that strong, nearly decades long foundation together and our continued
commitment to evolving that and growing those supports
for and with students and in service of schools,
districts and parents. - [Jamie] Thank you so much.
That was incredibly insightful. Turning back to Sarah, in your time, working across both orgs, what's your perspective
on how the partnership has evolved over time? - So I do remember starting
out at College Board about nine years ago when this partnership was beginning to launch. And I remember being really
excited to talk to districts about this free official SAT practice. And as Maureen said, that's when it was called
back then is SAT practice because Khan Academy had the content but also had practice
materials on our site. And as College Board
transitions to digital testing, the practice tests and practice
experience is now available in Blue Book, College Board's
digital testing application. And then that's important because
it gives students a chance to get comfortable with a platform that they're actually gonna
be taking the test on. And our focus at Kahn Academy
has shifted to SAT prep and it's just not the
test preppy type of things like test taking strategies and time management study skills. We obviously cover that
and that's super important. But really the powerful impact is the high quality course content that has been created
along with College Board. It's mastery enabled,
like our other courses are within the platform. And it truly assesses or
it covers what is assessed on the SAT. - [Jamie] Thank you so much Sarah. Maureen, what are you proud
of when you think about the partnership? - Honestly, I'm really proud
of the work we've done together and the way that we put
the learner at the center of everything that we do. So whether that's thinking about how students are receiving
their digital SAT prep course that could be sort of
on their mobile device. Right we are as digital natives where they have access to,
maybe it's just their phone, maybe it's something they're
doing on a school bus. It's the universal access
to digital SAT prep in many different spaces
through the classroom, on their own, but
connecting them to a coach that can really help support that journey becomes even more important to us as we think about students
that are taking SAT school day, PSAT and MSQT. That growth over time and each of those sort of assessment moments as
benchmarking their progress towards showing what they know on test day and unlocking those future opportunities for and with students. What I think about the
millions of learners that we connect to these
supports and to educators, helping them understand
where their students are, and where they need to go and grow next, that really inspires my work and how we think about growing the course in service of students. So whether that's through
adding additional content together, going to a next level of detail through the videos,
articles, worked examples that help students really understand the underlying knowledge and skills that they will build
upon as they move through each of the foundational steps of understanding the knowledge and skills assessed on the SAT
with the types of items that they will experience in Blue Book, our digital testing application. There's so much work that we do together to build familiarity with the platform students will utilize on test day, but even how to navigate the tools that they will experience. A great example of this
is getting familiar with the Desmos calculator
that students will use on test day. Knowing how to best leverage that tool that all students have access to. Is really an incredible
piece of our work together. And I think at the end of the day, what we're all trying to achieve is fully integrating
students understanding of the types of questions, items that students will
experience on test day in the moments where
they're actually learning those knowledge and
skills in the classroom. And to me, that integration
is what's going to really help students understand that
the SAT isn't something that happens at the end of high school. It's not just in service
of college entrance. It's really an assessment that's designed to help students show what they know and what they've learned
all throughout high school and together by both connecting students with the online course itself, but actually the educators
who are helping them attain those knowledge and skills
throughout high school. That to me is the power of
our connection together, our reach and our ability to
make meaningful impact at scale for all students. - [Jamie] Thank you so much Maureen. We're gonna shift to Sarah, who's our District Success Manager. And so can you speak to the
support that you provide to districts related to digital SAT prep? - Yeah, so part of what I do is I can act as a thought partner with you. We know that every school
has different circumstances and we can provide guidance and resources to support a variety of
implementation models. Your district may have
designated SAT prep courses that students are required or
elected to take for instance. Or your district may have advisory or seminar win times
where you want to engage with SAT prep. And Avi, if you could share
the screen back again. There we go. And the
next one, there we go. So lots of different
ways to implement SAT. As I mentioned, designated
SAT prep courses, advisory seminar times. We could also talk to you
if you have an afterschool or summer school program and you want to utilize SAT prep there. Maybe you aren't able to
designate specific times and you need to embed SAT
prep into your core classes. We can help with those strategies. And then you could also
have supportive parents that want to help their students engage with the digital SAT prep classes at home. It is important to engage
students, keep them motivated, so we have resources such as data trackers that students can use to
monitor their own short and long-term goals. Finally, some of our districts
strategically think about four year plans for SAT prep. That use a combination
of our SAT prep courses along with our other course content. One of our district partners with a four year
implementation success plan is the school district of
Osceola County in Florida. Osceola has about 70,000
students in over 80 schools who speak about a 100 different languages. And the district sets
expectations that students are to use Khan Academy
for 30 minutes a week and to level up two skills per week in grades nine through 12. Every school has the autonomy
for how they want students to get this time, but their
fidelity of implementation and creating a culture of expectation has really led to student success with their graduation rate being
at an all time high of 91%. Osceola attributes,
the use of Khan Academy to much of the success, we
have a blog post on our website if you wanna learn more
about their implementation. Another success story is Garland in Texas. Garland ISD has over 51,000 students they're are outside the Dallas area. Garland administrators emphasized
the use of Khan Academy six weeks prior to students taking the SAT and they expect students
to use Khan Academy for 30 minutes a week. The great thing about Garland is that they did their own
analysis of students PSAT/NMSQT and SAT test scores. And correlated that to the amount of time that they spent within the platform. They looked at students' scores when they took the PSAT/NMSQT in the fall of their 10th grade year, so the fall of their 11th grade year. This comparison is shown
in the first set of columns on the chart. Then they looked at their
The PSAT/NMSQT from the fall of their junior year to the SAT in the spring of their junior year, which is that second set of columns. As you can see in the charts, all students did improve
their test scores, but students who used Khan Academy for more than a 100
minutes had statistically significant higher scores than
students who spent less time. Now I'd like to pivot to
talk about one of the reasons why these districts had so much success using the SAT prep courses. And that's really due to how
the courses are structured. College Board makes it known
what is assessed on the SAT. It's not a secret. They publish an assessment framework, you can find it on their website. And within the reading
and writing section, students are assessed in
four different domains. Information and ideas,
craft and structure, expression of ideas, and
standard English conventions. And on the right is a screenshot of the SAT prep course in Khan Academy, and you can see how these
units align to those domains. You can also see that there
are foundational units, there are medium units,
there are advanced units, so that we're scaffolding all
of these skills for students to provide additional support. The math course is
structured in the same way. There's also four domains
assessed on the SAT math section, the algebra, advanced math,
geometry, and trigonometry, and problem solving and data analysis. The units are again, scaffolded
with increasing difficulty and aligned to those
domains being assessed. And then we can go even
deeper into the structure of the assessment and the courses. Because the courses
review all of the skills that are on the SAT. And as Maureen mentioned, these
skills are enduring skills that students are learning
in their classroom. And so, for example, in the
information and ideas domain, one of the skills assessed
is command of evidence. And within the screenshot
there you will see that command of evidence
and all of the skills assessed on the SAT are
embedded within our courses. And this is really important because knowing that all of the skills that are assessed on the
SAT are in the prep courses. It's extremely powerful
and impactful for students who are preparing to take the SAT. Diona's gonna show you how
all of this is demonstrated in our platform. So Jamie, I'll let you introduce Diona. - All right, so Diona Clingman
is an experienced educator with over 20 years in the field, hailing from Flint, Michigan. She has served in various roles
including classroom teacher, director of academics, and principal. Diona is skilled in using AI for SAT prep, and she is passionate about fostering a positive learning environment
while empowering students and educators alike. - Well, hello everyone and thank you Jamie for that introduction. So now on the screen, what
you see is the landing page of what your students will see when they begin working in
the digital SAT courses. So kind of thinking about
kind of what Sarah just said previously about how they're aligned, now we're gonna look at how
these courses are formatted. Each one of these
courses, as she mentioned, are broken down into units. And within these units,
students now have access to some learning tools,
articles, and videos that help break down some
of those key concepts that may be hard for them. And so they can watch a video,
they can read an article. Students can also practice their learning through practice exercises. They can also take quizzes
as well as unit test. Now, once a student begins
working in the platform, one way that they can kind
of ma track how they're doing is through this section here, which is our mastery dashboard. Now on this mastery dashboard, students in real time will get feedback on how they're doing on
each one of these skills. Based on our four mastery levels, our four mastery levels
are attempted, familiar, proficient, and mastered. And so this allows
students to be able to see what are those areas that
I still need to work on. Or what are those areas
that I'm okay, you know, that I'm mastering. The goal for all of your
students will be for them to get into this purple area,
this proficient and mastered. Now this along with the
ability for teachers to track student progress
is all available free on our platform, but I'm a
former building principal, so I know the ability to look at analytics for my building and look
at data is very important. So now let me show you that if you partner with Khan Academy, how
you'll be able to have access to this data and leverage it. You'll be able to get to
your administrator dashboard by clicking on your name. And you'll see that there is a option for you to go to your
administrator dashboard. Now when you go into
this wide array of data, you're gonna see very high
level on this landing page, how your district or your school is doing. Now, if you are a building principal, you're only gonna have
access to your data. But if you are a district
level administrator, you'll be able to see all the schools that are in your specific district. When you look at the landing page, you're gonna see very high level. You'll be able to track the activation of your students and teachers. You'll be able to see are your student, how are your students
doing when it comes to them getting in that purple area
were just talking about. How many of those skills
are in that proficient or master area. You can also track Khanmigo usage, our AI tool that was kind
of mentioned earlier. You can track learning minutes. How many minutes are the
students in your school or your district. How much time are they
spending within the platform? And then you can also
see skills leveled up. So are they improving going
from that attempted to familiar or even familiar to proficient. Now on the left hand side,
along with that assistance as well from your
district support manager, that will help you kind of be
able to interpret this data. On the left hand side,
you're able to drill down a little bit more into your data. So over here, when we look at
activation, if I drill down, I can see that I can monitor
activation by school, I can do it by grades. I can also do it by teacher. So for example, if I
wanna look at my teachers. Here, I'm able to see all of my teachers, I'm able to see if their
accounts are activated, the number of students
that are rostered to them, and then whether or not
their students have activated their accounts as well
as started an activity. So this is just a great way to find out who are those teachers that
need that little bit of support with getting started, getting
the students on the platform and you know, getting
them started in utilizing that digital SAT content. Now once everybody's
accounts are activated and I see that students
accounts are activated, then the next thing I may
wanna start looking at is progress, how are we doing, right? So then when I go over here to progress, and if I drill down, now I'm able to see a
couple different options. I can see it by course,
I can see it by school, I can see it by grades,
teachers, and even skills. So if I wanted to start
looking at how are, you know, how are the students doing
in the digital SAT courses, I can click on courses. And now I'm brought to, what is it called? Our progress by course report. Here I can filter by specific
date range, my school, my grades, and then I
can also just scroll down and find my digital SAT. And then I'm now able to
see just how they're doing on those specific courses. Now here it is kind of telling
me how my students are doing and how much time they're
spending in the platform. So here I see, here's my
digital SAT math course. I see the number of students
that are in this course, and once your teacher's a part of their professional development, they'll be trained on
how to add this course so that you as the administrator can start tracking progress. And so here it shows me
the number of students that are in this course,
their learning minutes. How are they spending time
within this timeframe? How many skills did they work on? The average number of
skills they worked on within this timeframe. And then did they level up? Did they go from that
attempted to familiar, or familiar to proficient? And then also I'm able to
track how many of those skills landed in that purple. I can also drill down
and look at it by school. And then within my school, start looking at those specific teachers. And then from those specific teachers, I can also look at specific students. So if you have a teacher come to and say, you know, Diona's having a hard time in her digital SAT math course with, you know, with leveling up, this is the way you can start. You know, you'll have your own set of data to be able to look at Diona. And then say, okay, this
is how you know this is... And start that conversation
with your teacher and see how the two of
you can work together to support your student. You also have the ability
to monitor Khanmigo usage. So you can look at usage
as well as activity. So in a world where your
students are utilizing Khanmigo in that digital SAT course,
because you know they're stuck and they need that extra support, we can go here to activity. Now here I can see what
activities my students are using Khanmigo on. And when I go here with them
using it with an exercise, I can drill down and when I
drill down I can see the course. And here's my digital SAT math course. And so when I drill down
here, now I'm able to even see what specific units they worked on, as well as the number of students
who utilize this as well. So if I see that I have a lot
of students using it, great. If I see I have a small
number of students using it, then that can be a
conversation maybe in a PLC or with my teachers around
how can we increase this usage or what is the root cause
as to how our students are having issues with utilizing Khanmigo. Also, on your admin dashboard, you do have access to resources, everything from our Khan
Academy Administrator guide, which is a step by step
guide that will guide you through not only navigating the platform, but also how to read
these reports as well. And then we also have our
Khan for Educators course. These are very detailed videos in which we show you kind of step by step how to have a successful
implementation as well. And now we're going to also begin, Jamie's gonna talk to
you a little bit about how you can use AI for SAT prep. - Thank you so much, Diona. Let me just go ahead and share my screen. All right, so I am gonna show
you the student experience using Khanmigo, which is
an on-demand student tutor, available 24/7 specifically
for SAT preparation when used in conjunction with the Khan Academy SAT Resources. So on my screen you can
see the Explore Foundations in algebra course on the
digital SAT suite of courses. We see, like, you know,
other Khan Academy courses, progression is rooted in mastery and this is something Diona
showed you a few minutes ago. We also see that, you know,
when we hit the start button, we see that students
experience the familiar feel of all the other Khan Academy courses. And so if we go ahead and
get started with a question, we see that Khanmigo is there, right there to help students
work through exercises should they need assistance. And so what's really nice
is that students can begin a session simply by using a
prompt bubble or by typing or speaking their question
into the designated area. So from the teacher's perspective, Khanmigo is their version
of receiving assistance through teacher tools, which include things like lesson planning, receiving a class snapshot, and through getting a list
of recommended assignments. So by utilizing those teacher tools. I'm so sorry, by utilizing
those teacher tools, teachers can get assistance
with progress on SAT prep, group students based on recent work and help meet students'
needs in less time. Now, safety and privacy are paramount. We are committed to
ensuring that kids are safe and their information is private. With the Khanmigo partnership, teachers and administrators
have full visibility into everything that
students are working on and chatting about. Our guardrails ensure
that students are safe and monitored at all times. In addition, the Socratic
method of questioning by Khanmigo ensures that
students think deeply during their SAT practice without ever getting the answers directly. As we near the end of this webinar, we wanted to highlight the
district partnership difference. As most of you know, many
of Khan Academy's resources and tools are free. Khan Academy houses the
only SAT prep course created in partnership with College Board. On our platform, visitors have access to all standards aligned courses, including the digital SAT course, progress monitoring
and growth on SAT prep. And teachers can create
targeted assignments as needed. As mentioned before, practice test scores from the College Board Blue
Book app prompts students to visit Khan Academy to
practice skill improvement. As part of a district partnership. Our partners benefit from
automated seamless rostering, administrator reporting,
professional learning for teachers and administrators, a
district success manager, and access to our AI
student tutor Khanmigo. As a reminder, our teacher tools are free, but our district partners receive access to our enterprise Khanmigo tools. Last but not least, we'd
like to introduce you to our district partnerships team. Danielle Sullivan covers
our Northeast Territory. Renee Venegas, myself and
Mark Jamison cover our south and southeast regions. Jason Feig spearheads
partnerships in the Midwest. Jason Hovey and Chelsea Hatchard together cover the Western region
of the United States. With that, if you are interested
in a district partnership with Khan Academy, scan this QR code, which will put you in touch
with our district's team. As a reminder, participants
who RSVP'd to this event, will have access to the video recording. Thank you for joining us today, and a special thank you to

College and Khan Academy: District-wide Strategies for SAT Prep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN2ABy7xSEA,"- As we continue to admit folks, we wanna remind everyone that today's session is being recorded. Feel free to add your
questions in the chat. We have a host of Khan Academy folks ready to answer your
questions in real time. We are thrilled to have you join us as we explore an exciting
partnership between Khan Academy and the College Board. This collaboration signifies
a groundbreaking step forward in educational support and resources, specifically designed to
enhance student success. Today we'll delve into the unique benefits of the Khan Academy District
Partnership Program, which offers schools access
to a comprehensive suite of resources tailored to
improve SAT preparation and overall academic performance. Our goal is to equip educators and students with vetted high
quality practice materials that not only boost test scores, but also positively
impact graduation rates across partnering school districts. As we navigate through the
details of this partnership, you'll learn how Khan
Academy's innovative approach to personalized learning
can empower students, providing them with the tools
they need to improve outcomes on the digital SAT. We'll share insights, success stories, and practical implementation strategies that will help you understand how this partnership can be a game changer for your district. So sit back and prepare to discover the transformative potential of the Khan Academy and
College Board partnership. My name is Jamie Grant, and
I'll be your host for today. For 20 years, I was a science
teacher in both public and independent schools. Beginning my journey into the classroom after having completed the
DC Teaching Fellows program. During my time as a K-12 educator, I served as a department
chairperson, class sponsor, teacher trainer, advisor, and mentor. But since leaving the classroom,
I've served in the capacity of a senior customer success manager, grant program directorate, and currently as a district
partnerships manager for the southeast region. It is my pleasure to introduce to you our speakers for today,
Diona Clingman, Sarah Thaler, both from Khan Academy, as well as Maureen Foreman
from the College Board. So with that, we're going
to ask them a few questions and chat more about the
partnership between Khan Academy and College Board. Sarah, Sarah Thaler brings a wealth of information and
experience to our session. She spent her early career as
a high school science teacher and building administrator. Then transitioned to the College Board where she dedicated eight years to enhancing educational assessments, culminating in her role
as the Senior Director of Institutional Assessment Management. Currently, Sarah serves
as a Success Manager at Khan Academy, where she collaborates with districts and higher
education institutions to facilitate the
successful implementation of Khan Academy and Khanmigo. Her expertise will illuminate the benefits of our partnership and show
how it can positively impact students across our districts. Welcome Sarah. Maureen Foreman is Vice President of SAT Suite Program and
Innovation at College Board. She began her career as a
teacher in Philadelphia, with the New Teacher Project, and she was a Teach for America mentor. Maureen, can you tell us
about College Board's mission and what inspires you to
do your work every day? - Thanks, Jamie. So College Board's mission ultimately is to connect students with
post-secondary opportunities in college and career. Our goal is to make sure
that students understand a bit more about themselves, what they know and what they don't know, and how we can support
them in their journey toward their best fit
path after high school. As you mentioned, I am
also a former educator, and so there's a lot of
synergy between College Board and Khan Academy's mission
to connect students with those opportunities. In the SAT Suite, the core of what we do helps students understand
the knowledge and skills that they are learning in high school every step of the way. When we think about our connection
to students and families, we also think about
scholarship opportunities and the doors that we unlock to potential future opportunities. We're all about connecting
students to that next step on their path to learning and to growth. And I think at the end of the day, as people together who are in education and in support of students
as learners and educators as people sort of shepherding young minds, That is really what drives us forward and connects our work together. - [Jamie] Thanks, Maureen. Sarah, what can you tell us
about Khan Academy's mission and how your work on SAT
connects to that vision? - Thanks Jamie. Khan Academy's mission
is to provide a free world class education to anyone, anywhere, and with our partnership
with College Board, any student could create
a Khan Academy account and access those digital SAT prep courses completely for free. This obviously eliminates the
barriers of costly SAT prep, it's for everyone, not just
for those who can afford it. And it's fantastic, a great
opportunity for students to have this opportunity, but the administrators
you're kind of blind into their progress and how they're using this SAT prep courses. So this is where really the power of Khan Academy partnership comes in. You can get valuable
insights into the skills that students are working on. You get administrator analytics, access to professional learning, support with rostering, access to a district success
manager that can help you with your implementation. Also, you could potentially
have access to Khanmigo. Which is our one-to-one
personal tutor for students and a teacher assistant
for all of your teachers. This allows you to be more supportive and more intentional
in how you are helping your students prepare for the SAT. - [Jamie] Thank you so much,
Sarah. Going back to Maureen. Maureen, can you tell us about how the partnership came to be? - Yes, so we are, if you can believe it, about to celebrate our 10
year anniversary together as partners. Through this nearly
decade long partnership. We've learned a lot about ourselves, our respective organizations, and the way we most effectively
work for and with students. The reason that we sort of
embarked on this partnership back in the day is we really
believe that it is our role to clear path for all students to have access to free, high quality, continuously improving test prep that can be utilized in a variety of ways, whether that's to an individual
learner on their own, for a student who's working with a tutor or other support within their school, or maybe most effectively
and most importantly, integrated into their classroom experience with the teachers and educators
who are supporting students to and through their knowledge that are really assessed on the SAT. We think about the SAT, it
is essentially an assessment of the core knowledge
and skills that students are developing and sort of growing in their courses across high school. So whether that's in
math courses or reading and writing courses, each of those skills really build upon themselves. So year over year students
are in their classes building those knowledge and skills that are assessed on the SAT. The digital SAT really
measures what matters and practice makes progress, right? So by having our partnership
with Khan Academy so widely available to
individual students, we also know that supporting
educators with the use of that tool in the classroom
really moves the needle when it comes to how students
understand the knowledge and skills that are assessed on the test, the type of items that help
to assess their knowledge, and really the way that students do that with the caring
adults in their lives, whether those are, again,
parents, tutors, educators. That can look really different
in terms of a support system for students. And Khan Academy really helps
us to scale the knowledge and expertise that students
will need to be successful, not just on the test, but
ultimately in connecting them to those resources supports
for college career and beyond. And so to me, what
really inspires the work that we do together is how
we think about the learner at the center of everything we do. Some of the features that
I love about Khan Academy in general, but specifically
in the digital SAT course, is it helps students move
through foundation all the way up through mastery of the
knowledge and skills assessed on the SAT. We've built this partnership
by leveraging the items that are written by the makers of the SAT, so authored by College Board
shared with Khan Academy. And then Khan Academy
really helps us to scale sort of explanations
of knowledge and skills that help students refresh their knowledge of what they've already
learned in certain classes, and then to see that grow
through foundation's, advanced mastery level learning in their Khan Academy courses. So as you've heard on this call, many of us come from a
background in education. We really think about
how do we meet students where they are and how do we help them sort of track their progress
and really grow that knowledge over time. So whether that's through
refreshing knowledge skills or sometimes really learning
them for the first time or learning them in a
different way, there's so much that Khan Academy does to help
meet students where they are. And to help educators really
differentiate their instruction and tailor their work with students through those knowledge and skills. We've had tremendous impact
through official SAT practice, which was the original course that helped to support students through
the paper pencil version of the SAT. And now together in the digital space where our digital natives truly are, we're really thinking differently about how we more meaningfully make space for those connections in a
variety of different ways with educators, through our
partnerships, with states, with districts, and
with individual schools and educators themselves. Whether that's through a coaching model or whether that's through a
strategic district-wide adoption of Khan Academy for districts,
or even thinking about where Khanmigo has a place for students in really personalizing
and tailoring instruction and helping students grow the knowledge and skills that are assessed on the SAT. We just see tremendous growth potential from where we are today,
building on that strong, nearly decades long foundation together and our continued
commitment to evolving that and growing those supports
for and with students and in service of schools,
districts and parents. - [Jamie] Thank you so much.
That was incredibly insightful. Turning back to Sarah, in your time, working across both orgs, what's your perspective
on how the partnership has evolved over time? - So I do remember starting
out at College Board about nine years ago when this partnership was beginning to launch. And I remember being really
excited to talk to districts about this free official SAT practice. And as Maureen said, that's when it was called
back then is SAT practice because Khan Academy had the content but also had practice
materials on our site. And as College Board
transitions to digital testing, the practice tests and practice
experience is now available in Blue Book, College Board's
digital testing application. And then that's important because
it gives students a chance to get comfortable with a platform that they're actually gonna
be taking the test on. And our focus at Kahn Academy
has shifted to SAT prep and it's just not the
test preppy type of things like test taking strategies and time management study skills. We obviously cover that
and that's super important. But really the powerful impact is the high quality course content that has been created
along with College Board. It's mastery enabled,
like our other courses are within the platform. And it truly assesses or
it covers what is assessed on the SAT. - [Jamie] Thank you so much Sarah. Maureen, what are you proud
of when you think about the partnership? - Honestly, I'm really proud
of the work we've done together and the way that we put
the learner at the center of everything that we do. So whether that's thinking about how students are receiving
their digital SAT prep course that could be sort of
on their mobile device. Right we are as digital natives where they have access to,
maybe it's just their phone, maybe it's something they're
doing on a school bus. It's the universal access
to digital SAT prep in many different spaces
through the classroom, on their own, but
connecting them to a coach that can really help support that journey becomes even more important to us as we think about students
that are taking SAT school day, PSAT and MSQT. That growth over time and each of those sort of assessment moments as
benchmarking their progress towards showing what they know on test day and unlocking those future opportunities for and with students. What I think about the
millions of learners that we connect to these
supports and to educators, helping them understand
where their students are, and where they need to go and grow next, that really inspires my work and how we think about growing the course in service of students. So whether that's through
adding additional content together, going to a next level of detail through the videos,
articles, worked examples that help students really understand the underlying knowledge and skills that they will build
upon as they move through each of the foundational steps of understanding the knowledge and skills assessed on the SAT
with the types of items that they will experience in Blue Book, our digital testing application. There's so much work that we do together to build familiarity with the platform students will utilize on test day, but even how to navigate the tools that they will experience. A great example of this
is getting familiar with the Desmos calculator
that students will use on test day. Knowing how to best leverage that tool that all students have access to. Is really an incredible
piece of our work together. And I think at the end of the day, what we're all trying to achieve is fully integrating
students understanding of the types of questions, items that students will
experience on test day in the moments where
they're actually learning those knowledge and
skills in the classroom. And to me, that integration
is what's going to really help students understand that
the SAT isn't something that happens at the end of high school. It's not just in service
of college entrance. It's really an assessment that's designed to help students show what they know and what they've learned
all throughout high school and together by both connecting students with the online course itself, but actually the educators
who are helping them attain those knowledge and skills
throughout high school. That to me is the power of
our connection together, our reach and our ability to
make meaningful impact at scale for all students. - [Jamie] Thank you so much Maureen. We're gonna shift to Sarah, who's our District Success Manager. And so can you speak to the
support that you provide to districts related to digital SAT prep? - Yeah, so part of what I do is I can act as a thought partner with you. We know that every school
has different circumstances and we can provide guidance and resources to support a variety of
implementation models. Your district may have
designated SAT prep courses that students are required or
elected to take for instance. Or your district may have advisory or seminar win times
where you want to engage with SAT prep. And Avi, if you could share
the screen back again. There we go. And the
next one, there we go. So lots of different
ways to implement SAT. As I mentioned, designated
SAT prep courses, advisory seminar times. We could also talk to you
if you have an afterschool or summer school program and you want to utilize SAT prep there. Maybe you aren't able to
designate specific times and you need to embed SAT
prep into your core classes. We can help with those strategies. And then you could also
have supportive parents that want to help their students engage with the digital SAT prep classes at home. It is important to engage
students, keep them motivated, so we have resources such as data trackers that students can use to
monitor their own short and long-term goals. Finally, some of our districts
strategically think about four year plans for SAT prep. That use a combination
of our SAT prep courses along with our other course content. One of our district partners with a four year
implementation success plan is the school district of
Osceola County in Florida. Osceola has about 70,000
students in over 80 schools who speak about a 100 different languages. And the district sets
expectations that students are to use Khan Academy
for 30 minutes a week and to level up two skills per week in grades nine through 12. Every school has the autonomy
for how they want students to get this time, but their
fidelity of implementation and creating a culture of expectation has really led to student success with their graduation rate being
at an all time high of 91%. Osceola attributes,
the use of Khan Academy to much of the success, we
have a blog post on our website if you wanna learn more
about their implementation. Another success story is Garland in Texas. Garland ISD has over 51,000 students they're are outside the Dallas area. Garland administrators emphasized
the use of Khan Academy six weeks prior to students taking the SAT and they expect students
to use Khan Academy for 30 minutes a week. The great thing about Garland is that they did their own
analysis of students PSAT/NMSQT and SAT test scores. And correlated that to the amount of time that they spent within the platform. They looked at students' scores when they took the PSAT/NMSQT in the fall of their 10th grade year, so the fall of their 11th grade year. This comparison is shown
in the first set of columns on the chart. Then they looked at their
The PSAT/NMSQT from the fall of their junior year to the SAT in the spring of their junior year, which is that second set of columns. As you can see in the charts, all students did improve
their test scores, but students who used Khan Academy for more than a 100
minutes had statistically significant higher scores than
students who spent less time. Now I'd like to pivot to
talk about one of the reasons why these districts had so much success using the SAT prep courses. And that's really due to how
the courses are structured. College Board makes it known
what is assessed on the SAT. It's not a secret. They publish an assessment framework, you can find it on their website. And within the reading
and writing section, students are assessed in
four different domains. Information and ideas,
craft and structure, expression of ideas, and
standard English conventions. And on the right is a screenshot of the SAT prep course in Khan Academy, and you can see how these
units align to those domains. You can also see that there
are foundational units, there are medium units,
there are advanced units, so that we're scaffolding all
of these skills for students to provide additional support. The math course is
structured in the same way. There's also four domains
assessed on the SAT math section, the algebra, advanced math,
geometry, and trigonometry, and problem solving and data analysis. The units are again, scaffolded
with increasing difficulty and aligned to those
domains being assessed. And then we can go even
deeper into the structure of the assessment and the courses. Because the courses
review all of the skills that are on the SAT. And as Maureen mentioned, these
skills are enduring skills that students are learning
in their classroom. And so, for example, in the
information and ideas domain, one of the skills assessed
is command of evidence. And within the screenshot
there you will see that command of evidence
and all of the skills assessed on the SAT are
embedded within our courses. And this is really important because knowing that all of the skills that are assessed on the
SAT are in the prep courses. It's extremely powerful
and impactful for students who are preparing to take the SAT. Diona's gonna show you how
all of this is demonstrated in our platform. So Jamie, I'll let you introduce Diona. - All right, so Diona Clingman
is an experienced educator with over 20 years in the field, hailing from Flint, Michigan. She has served in various roles
including classroom teacher, director of academics, and principal. Diona is skilled in using AI for SAT prep, and she is passionate about fostering a positive learning environment
while empowering students and educators alike. - Well, hello everyone and thank you Jamie for that introduction. So now on the screen, what
you see is the landing page of what your students will see when they begin working in
the digital SAT courses. So kind of thinking about
kind of what Sarah just said previously about how they're aligned, now we're gonna look at how
these courses are formatted. Each one of these
courses, as she mentioned, are broken down into units. And within these units,
students now have access to some learning tools,
articles, and videos that help break down some
of those key concepts that may be hard for them. And so they can watch a video,
they can read an article. Students can also practice their learning through practice exercises. They can also take quizzes
as well as unit test. Now, once a student begins
working in the platform, one way that they can kind
of ma track how they're doing is through this section here, which is our mastery dashboard. Now on this mastery dashboard, students in real time will get feedback on how they're doing on
each one of these skills. Based on our four mastery levels, our four mastery levels
are attempted, familiar, proficient, and mastered. And so this allows
students to be able to see what are those areas that
I still need to work on. Or what are those areas
that I'm okay, you know, that I'm mastering. The goal for all of your
students will be for them to get into this purple area,
this proficient and mastered. Now this along with the
ability for teachers to track student progress
is all available free on our platform, but I'm a
former building principal, so I know the ability to look at analytics for my building and look
at data is very important. So now let me show you that if you partner with Khan Academy, how
you'll be able to have access to this data and leverage it. You'll be able to get to
your administrator dashboard by clicking on your name. And you'll see that there is a option for you to go to your
administrator dashboard. Now when you go into
this wide array of data, you're gonna see very high
level on this landing page, how your district or your school is doing. Now, if you are a building principal, you're only gonna have
access to your data. But if you are a district
level administrator, you'll be able to see all the schools that are in your specific district. When you look at the landing page, you're gonna see very high level. You'll be able to track the activation of your students and teachers. You'll be able to see are your student, how are your students
doing when it comes to them getting in that purple area
were just talking about. How many of those skills
are in that proficient or master area. You can also track Khanmigo usage, our AI tool that was kind
of mentioned earlier. You can track learning minutes. How many minutes are the
students in your school or your district. How much time are they
spending within the platform? And then you can also
see skills leveled up. So are they improving going
from that attempted to familiar or even familiar to proficient. Now on the left hand side,
along with that assistance as well from your
district support manager, that will help you kind of be
able to interpret this data. On the left hand side,
you're able to drill down a little bit more into your data. So over here, when we look at
activation, if I drill down, I can see that I can monitor
activation by school, I can do it by grades. I can also do it by teacher. So for example, if I
wanna look at my teachers. Here, I'm able to see all of my teachers, I'm able to see if their
accounts are activated, the number of students
that are rostered to them, and then whether or not
their students have activated their accounts as well
as started an activity. So this is just a great way to find out who are those teachers that
need that little bit of support with getting started, getting
the students on the platform and you know, getting
them started in utilizing that digital SAT content. Now once everybody's
accounts are activated and I see that students
accounts are activated, then the next thing I may
wanna start looking at is progress, how are we doing, right? So then when I go over here to progress, and if I drill down, now I'm able to see a
couple different options. I can see it by course,
I can see it by school, I can see it by grades,
teachers, and even skills. So if I wanted to start
looking at how are, you know, how are the students doing
in the digital SAT courses, I can click on courses. And now I'm brought to, what is it called? Our progress by course report. Here I can filter by specific
date range, my school, my grades, and then I
can also just scroll down and find my digital SAT. And then I'm now able to
see just how they're doing on those specific courses. Now here it is kind of telling
me how my students are doing and how much time they're
spending in the platform. So here I see, here's my
digital SAT math course. I see the number of students
that are in this course, and once your teacher's a part of their professional development, they'll be trained on
how to add this course so that you as the administrator can start tracking progress. And so here it shows me
the number of students that are in this course,
their learning minutes. How are they spending time
within this timeframe? How many skills did they work on? The average number of
skills they worked on within this timeframe. And then did they level up? Did they go from that
attempted to familiar, or familiar to proficient? And then also I'm able to
track how many of those skills landed in that purple. I can also drill down
and look at it by school. And then within my school, start looking at those specific teachers. And then from those specific teachers, I can also look at specific students. So if you have a teacher come to and say, you know, Diona's having a hard time in her digital SAT math course with, you know, with leveling up, this is the way you can start. You know, you'll have your own set of data to be able to look at Diona. And then say, okay, this
is how you know this is... And start that conversation
with your teacher and see how the two of
you can work together to support your student. You also have the ability
to monitor Khanmigo usage. So you can look at usage
as well as activity. So in a world where your
students are utilizing Khanmigo in that digital SAT course,
because you know they're stuck and they need that extra support, we can go here to activity. Now here I can see what
activities my students are using Khanmigo on. And when I go here with them
using it with an exercise, I can drill down and when I
drill down I can see the course. And here's my digital SAT math course. And so when I drill down
here, now I'm able to even see what specific units they worked on, as well as the number of students
who utilize this as well. So if I see that I have a lot
of students using it, great. If I see I have a small
number of students using it, then that can be a
conversation maybe in a PLC or with my teachers around
how can we increase this usage or what is the root cause
as to how our students are having issues with utilizing Khanmigo. Also, on your admin dashboard, you do have access to resources, everything from our Khan
Academy Administrator guide, which is a step by step
guide that will guide you through not only navigating the platform, but also how to read
these reports as well. And then we also have our
Khan for Educators course. These are very detailed videos in which we show you kind of step by step how to have a successful
implementation as well. And now we're going to also begin, Jamie's gonna talk to
you a little bit about how you can use AI for SAT prep. - Thank you so much, Diona. Let me just go ahead and share my screen. All right, so I am gonna show
you the student experience using Khanmigo, which is
an on-demand student tutor, available 24/7 specifically
for SAT preparation when used in conjunction with the Khan Academy SAT Resources. So on my screen you can
see the Explore Foundations in algebra course on the
digital SAT suite of courses. We see, like, you know,
other Khan Academy courses, progression is rooted in mastery and this is something Diona
showed you a few minutes ago. We also see that, you know,
when we hit the start button, we see that students
experience the familiar feel of all the other Khan Academy courses. And so if we go ahead and
get started with a question, we see that Khanmigo is there, right there to help students
work through exercises should they need assistance. And so what's really nice
is that students can begin a session simply by using a
prompt bubble or by typing or speaking their question
into the designated area. So from the teacher's perspective, Khanmigo is their version
of receiving assistance through teacher tools, which include things like lesson planning, receiving a class snapshot, and through getting a list
of recommended assignments. So by utilizing those teacher tools. I'm so sorry, by utilizing
those teacher tools, teachers can get assistance
with progress on SAT prep, group students based on recent work and help meet students'
needs in less time. Now, safety and privacy are paramount. We are committed to
ensuring that kids are safe and their information is private. With the Khanmigo partnership, teachers and administrators
have full visibility into everything that
students are working on and chatting about. Our guardrails ensure
that students are safe and monitored at all times. In addition, the Socratic
method of questioning by Khanmigo ensures that
students think deeply during their SAT practice without ever getting the answers directly. As we near the end of this webinar, we wanted to highlight the
district partnership difference. As most of you know, many
of Khan Academy's resources and tools are free. Khan Academy houses the
only SAT prep course created in partnership with College Board. On our platform, visitors have access to all standards aligned courses, including the digital SAT course, progress monitoring
and growth on SAT prep. And teachers can create
targeted assignments as needed. As mentioned before, practice test scores from the College Board Blue
Book app prompts students to visit Khan Academy to
practice skill improvement. As part of a district partnership. Our partners benefit from
automated seamless rostering, administrator reporting,
professional learning for teachers and administrators, a
district success manager, and access to our AI
student tutor Khanmigo. As a reminder, our teacher tools are free, but our district partners receive access to our enterprise Khanmigo tools. Last but not least, we'd
like to introduce you to our district partnerships team. Danielle Sullivan covers
our Northeast Territory. Renee Venegas, myself and
Mark Jamison cover our south and southeast regions. Jason Feig spearheads
partnerships in the Midwest. Jason Hovey and Chelsea Hatchard together cover the Western region
of the United States. With that, if you are interested
in a district partnership with Khan Academy, scan this QR code, which will put you in touch
with our district's team. As a reminder, participants
who RSVP'd to this event, will have access to the video recording. Thank you for joining us today, and a special thank you to
Maureen Forman for joining us. We are eternally grateful for your time and the continued
collaboration and partnership between College Board and Khan Academy.

Proportional reasoning with motion | Physics | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJWRXgqn8PA,"- [Lecturer] NASA is researching
how to send humans to Mars by as early as 2030. Now, this is a complex mission, because you're traveling
for millions of kilometers, and this will involve a lot of things, like you'll think about
how much fuel you need, how much oxygen we need, and then how much time we'll
be spending over there, and how much radiation
exposure humans will be having. So many different things. So how do we figure out
what's the best approach? Well, what we usually do is try to come up with different plans. I can call that as Mission
A, Mission B, Mission C, and so on and so forth. And then we try to create
mathematical models for them, and then compare the models
to find the trade-offs. And then, eventually, we
finalize on one of them. And so the goal of this
video is to get a glimpse of how to create mathematical
models and compare them. Now, of course, we'll not do
it for such a complex mission. We'll simplify it. So in our case, we'll
assume that the spacecraft is traveling in a straight line, because that's simple, and we'll assume that it's traveling with a constant acceleration. And lastly, we'll assume that
the initial velocity is zero. So for the first case, let's assume, let's call this Mission A, let's assume that the acceleration is 10 meters per second square, which is very close to the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. So the astronauts over there would be feeling pretty much at home. And the spacecraft will
travel some distance, let's call it delta X, in some time. But now, let's create a
second plan, second mission, in which, again, it's
constant acceleration, initial velocity is zero. It's gonna travel the same delta X, but in half the time, okay? Now, our goal is to compare
some of the mission parameters. The first thing you would
compare is the average velocity. I mean, think about it, right? If we want to go from here to here in half the time as over here, then clearly, the average
velocity over here would be higher than over here. That makes intuitive sense. But how much higher? We want to compare that. So to do that, we wanna build a mathematical
model for the average velocity and then compare them. So let's do that. We can try using the model
for average velocity, which is delta X divided by t. Let's see if this model is useful for us. Well, first of all, we need
to compare average velocity. So it's good that that's there, okay? What about delta X? We know the relationship between them, they're exactly the same. Delta X for Mission B is the
same as delta X for Mission A. We're considering the same
delta X value, so that's good. And what about time? We also know the
relationship between them. We know the time over here has to be half the time over here. So time for B is half the time for A. So since we know the relationship
for this between these two and the relationship for
this between these two, we can now use this equation, use this model to find the relationship between the average
velocity between the two. So this is gonna be a useful model. Now, imagine if you had used
a model for average velocity, which involved acceleration, then that wouldn't be useful because we don't know the relationship between the accelerations, right? We don't know what the
acceleration over here is. And so that's why it's important
to pick the right models, but we don't have to worry too much. If you do pick a wrong model, we'll figure it out and we'll scratch it, and we'll use another model. Trial and error, no big deal, okay? Anyways, let's go ahead with this. Let's write down the average
velocity for Mission B. So we could say the average
velocity for Mission B would be delta XB devided by tB. And the average velocity for Mission A would be delta XA divided by tA. We know delta XB and
delta XA are the same, it's just delta X, so let's just call them as delta X. And now to compare them, we can just divide the two equation. And now we simplify. The delta X divides out. And so we get that equals one over tB divide by one over tA, which is tA divided by tB. And now we know what tB is. The time for this is half the time for A, we can plug that in. So if you get 1/2 tA, the tA divides out, and you end up with two. So look, this ratio ends up becoming two. So we can rearrange now, and write that the average
velocity in Mission B will be twice as much as the
average velocity in Mission A. So to cover the same
delta X in half the time, we need twice the average velocity, which is not super obvious, because we're dealing with
accelerated motion over here. But now the interesting question is, could we have just looked at this equation and without doing the
math, figure this out? And the answer is yes. If you look at this model carefully, because delta X is the same for both, we can look at this and we
can say, hey, average velocity is proportional to 1 over t, or it's inversely proportional to t. What this means is that if
t changes by some factor, your average velocity will change by the reciprocal of that factor. So if t becomes double, your average velocity will
be reciprocal of that, 1/2. If t triples, the average
velocity reciprocal of that, one by third. In our case, the t became 1/2. So the average velocity
would be reciprocal of 1/2, which is two. And so immediately,
just by looking at this, we could have said, hey, if the t becomes 1/2, the average velocity would double. Powerful, right? All right, now let's see if
we can compare something else. Let's compare their accelerations. What's the acceleration in
Mission B compared to Mission A? And again, for that,
we need to use a model, this time a mathematical model that involves an acceleration. And one of such models is this. This is the model for things that are moving with
constant acceleration, right? Again, let's look at stuff
that we already know, and then see if this is
gonna be useful for us, okay? So what do we know? Well, first of all, since we have X that operates in the initial position, which is over here, we can just set that to zero. And then the X, which
is the final position, we can just call that as delta X. So we know those two, okay? That's the same for both of them. We also know the initial
velocity, which is V0, that is 0. And we know the time over here needs to be half the time over there. And finally, we know the
acceleration of the first one. So these other things
that are given to us. So the first thing we can do
is plug in wherever zeros are to make our model slightly simpler. So if you do that, this goes to zero, this becomes delta X, this goes to zero. So you'll look at delta
X equals 1/2 at square. And since I wanna compare accelerations, I will rearrange this
to get the acceleration. So acceleration becomes two
delta X divided by t square. And again, let's see if
this model is useful for us. I want to compare
acceleration, so that's great. I need accelerations. Do I know the relationship
between delta X? Yes, they're the same. And do I know the
relationship between time? Yes, I do. So I can use this to find the relationship between the accelerations. It'll be a great idea to pause the video and see if you can try this on your own. Very similar to what we did earlier. All right, let's do this. So we can write down the accelerations for both the missions. So for B it'll be two times
delta XB by tB square, and for A will be two
delta XA by tA square. But we know delta XB and
delta XA are exactly the same, so we can just get rid
of A and B over there. And we can divide the
two just like before. And then simplify. So the two delta X and two
delta X can divide out. That leaving us with one over tB square, divide by one over tA square. And then we can rearrange
this to get tA square divided by tB square. And again, we can finally
plug in what tB is, tB is 1/2 tA. If we plug that in over here, we get 1/2 tA, the whole squared. Finally, tA square divides out, leaving us with one divided
by 1 over 4, which is 4. So from this, I now know that the acceleration in Mission B would be four times as the
acceleration in Mission A. And so there we have it. We need four times more acceleration here, compared to over here. Four times more is 4 times 10, that is 40. And then we could say that, hey, 40 meters per second squared is too much of an acceleration
for humans to withstand. That's not gonna be possible, 'cause we'll be traveling for a long time. And so we could say that
no, we can't do that. Even if we reach in half the
time, that's not possible. But anyways, just like before, could we have figured this out
without doing the whole math? And the answer is again, yes. Again, if you look at the model carefully, we see that delta X is
the same for both of them, which means acceleration
will be proportional to 1 over t squared, or inversely proportional to t squared. This means whatever factor t changes by, acceleration will change by
the reciprocal of the square. So if t were to double, acceleration would be the
reciprocal 1/2 square, 1/4. If t were to triple,
acceleration would change by one over three reciprocal square, 1/9. But in our case, t became half. So acceleration would be
reciprocal two square, four. And there you have it. This is a very powerful way of doing this. Since we are having so much fun over here, we should try one more plan, Mission C. Here, we'll keep the same
acceleration as before, but we'll allow the spacecraft will travel for 50% more time than before. So same acceleration, but 50% more time. It's gonna travel farther, right? And the question is how much farther? So we know what to do by now. Think about our mathematical model. So again, since we're dealing with positions and accelerations, let's use the same model as before. Write down what we know. And at any moment, feel free to pause and try
this on your own, okay? But let's write down what we already know. We know, I mean, we can
set our X0 to be zero, the initial position to be zero, and the final position would just be X. So we can just set X0 to be zero. We also know the V0,
initial velocity, is zero. So we know that. We also know the
accelerations are the same in this time. So acceleration case A
and case C is the same. And we are allowing for 50% more time. So we know that the time here is 50% more, compared to time A,
which means 1.5 times A. So tC must be 1.5 times tA. And again, we can plug
in zeros to simplify. So this goes to zero, this goes to zero. And that gives us a simplified model, X, which is the final
position which we want. That is the model. So let's see if it's useful, okay? We want X, we want to compare that, so it's good that's there. Do we know the relationship
between the accelerations? Yes, the same accelerations. Do we know the relationship
between the time? Yes, we do. So we know the relationship
between time, 1.5 times tA. And so we can figure this out. Again, we can do the math, but we also know how to do
this in a shortcut now, right? So we can look at this model and we can say that, hey, since the acceleration is the same, since A is the same, X is directly proportional to t squared. So now whatever factor t changes by, X will change by the
square of that factor. You can see that's directly
proportional this time, right? So if t doubles, X will be, X will change by a factor of two square, if t triples, X will change
by a factor of three square. In our case, t has become 1.5 times more. So X will change by a
factor of 1.5 squared. So we can immediately write XC, the final position over here, okay, that has to be 1.5 times square XA, the final position over here. And if you simplify, 1.5 square is 2.25. And so we immediately get the answer. So XC would be 2.25 times XA, which is amazing if you
think about it, right? Just by 50% more time, it'll travel more than twice the distance, compared to the first one. And by the way, we can check the math, and I'll not go through
all the steps over here. I'll just show you all the steps. You can pause the video
and you can just see, if you divide it and, you
know, do it the long way, you get the same answer. But anyways, look at what this means. This means that, you
know, in the first case, if we allowed it to travel for one year, and let's say the distance it traveled was a billion kilometers, in the second case, if we
allow it 50% more time, which is 1 1/2 years, it will travel 2.25 billion kilometers. That's awesome. So, long story short, by using mathematical models, we can see how changing one variable affects the other variable. This is super useful
in comparing scenarios. What's important is that you
don't need actual values, you just need the models
and you can divide them out, and you can figure out, and you can compare, you know, whatever you want to compare. And another way is you can
do it without dividing, you can do it without doing the math, by just looking at the model, seeing what variables are
the same for them both, and then figuring out the
proportionality relationship, the right proportionality relationship. If you know the factor by
which one variable changes, we can figure out the factor by which the other variable
would change as well. This is not just useful for kinematics, it's useful for all physics.",Mission Planning for Mars Exploration,"This topic discusses the complexities of planning a human mission to Mars, including considerations such as fuel, oxygen, time spent on the planet, and radiation exposure.",00:00:00 - 00:01:30,2024-10-04T16:27:10Z,14466,196,12
Proportional reasoning with motion | Physics | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJWRXgqn8PA,"- [Lecturer] NASA is researching
how to send humans to Mars by as early as 2030. Now, this is a complex mission, because you're traveling
for millions of kilometers, and this will involve a lot of things, like you'll think about
how much fuel you need, how much oxygen we need, and then how much time we'll
be spending over there, and how much radiation
exposure humans will be having. So many different things. So how do we figure out
what's the best approach? Well, what we usually do is try to come up with different plans. I can call that as Mission
A, Mission B, Mission C, and so on and so forth. And then we try to create
mathematical models for them, and then compare the models
to find the trade-offs. And then, eventually, we
finalize on one of them. And so the goal of this
video is to get a glimpse of how to create mathematical
models and compare them. Now, of course, we'll not do
it for such a complex mission. We'll simplify it. So in our case, we'll
assume that the spacecraft is traveling in a straight line, because that's simple, and we'll assume that it's traveling with a constant acceleration. And lastly, we'll assume that
the initial velocity is zero. So for the first case, let's assume, let's call this Mission A, let's assume that the acceleration is 10 meters per second square, which is very close to the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. So the astronauts over there would be feeling pretty much at home. And the spacecraft will
travel some distance, let's call it delta X, in some time. But now, let's create a
second plan, second mission, in which, again, it's
constant acceleration, initial velocity is zero. It's gonna travel the same delta X, but in half the time, okay? Now, our goal is to compare
some of the mission parameters. The first thing you would
compare is the average velocity. I mean, think about it, right? If we want to go from here to here in half the time as over here, then clearly, the average
velocity over here would be higher than over here. That makes intuitive sense. But how much higher? We want to compare that. So to do that, we wanna build a mathematical
model for the average velocity and then compare them. So let's do that. We can try using the model
for average velocity, which is delta X divided by t. Let's see if this model is useful for us. Well, first of all, we need
to compare average velocity. So it's good that that's there, okay? What about delta X? We know the relationship between them, they're exactly the same. Delta X for Mission B is the
same as delta X for Mission A. We're considering the same
delta X value, so that's good. And what about time? We also know the
relationship between them. We know the time over here has to be half the time over here. So time for B is half the time for A. So since we know the relationship
for this between these two and the relationship for
this between these two, we can now use this equation, use this model to find the relationship between the average
velocity between the two. So this is gonna be a useful model. Now, imagine if you had used
a model for average velocity, which involved acceleration, then that wouldn't be useful because we don't know the relationship between the accelerations, right? We don't know what the
acceleration over here is. And so that's why it's important
to pick the right models, but we don't have to worry too much. If you do pick a wrong model, we'll figure it out and we'll scratch it, and we'll use another model. Trial and error, no big deal, okay? Anyways, let's go ahead with this. Let's write down the average
velocity for Mission B. So we could say the average
velocity for Mission B would be delta XB devided by tB. And the average velocity for Mission A would be delta XA divided by tA. We know delta XB and
delta XA are the same, it's just delta X, so let's just call them as delta X. And now to compare them, we can just divide the two equation. And now we simplify. The delta X divides out. And so we get that equals one over tB divide by one over tA, which is tA divided by tB. And now we know what tB is. The time for this is half the time for A, we can plug that in. So if you get 1/2 tA, the tA divides out, and you end up with two. So look, this ratio ends up becoming two. So we can rearrange now, and write that the average
velocity in Mission B will be twice as much as the
average velocity in Mission A. So to cover the same
delta X in half the time, we need twice the average velocity, which is not super obvious, because we're dealing with
accelerated motion over here. But now the interesting question is, could we have just looked at this equation and without doing the
math, figure this out? And the answer is yes. If you look at this model carefully, because delta X is the same for both, we can look at this and we
can say, hey, average velocity is proportional to 1 over t, or it's inversely proportional to t. What this means is that if
t changes by some factor, your average velocity will change by the reciprocal of that factor. So if t becomes double, your average velocity will
be reciprocal of that, 1/2. If t triples, the average
velocity reciprocal of that, one by third. In our case, the t became 1/2. So the average velocity
would be reciprocal of 1/2, which is two. And so immediately,
just by looking at this, we could have said, hey, if the t becomes 1/2, the average velocity would double. Powerful, right? All right, now let's see if
we can compare something else. Let's compare their accelerations. What's the acceleration in
Mission B compared to Mission A? And again, for that,
we need to use a model, this time a mathematical model that involves an acceleration. And one of such models is this. This is the model for things that are moving with
constant acceleration, right? Again, let's look at stuff
that we already know, and then see if this is
gonna be useful for us, okay? So what do we know? Well, first of all, since we have X that operates in the initial position, which is over here, we can just set that to zero. And then the X, which
is the final position, we can just call that as delta X. So we know those two, okay? That's the same for both of them. We also know the initial
velocity, which is V0, that is 0. And we know the time over here needs to be half the time over there. And finally, we know the
acceleration of the first one. So these other things
that are given to us. So the first thing we can do
is plug in wherever zeros are to make our model slightly simpler. So if you do that, this goes to zero, this becomes delta X, this goes to zero. So you'll look at delta
X equals 1/2 at square. And since I wanna compare accelerations, I will rearrange this
to get the acceleration. So acceleration becomes two
delta X divided by t square. And again, let's see if
this model is useful for us. I want to compare
acceleration, so that's great. I need accelerations. Do I know the relationship
between delta X? Yes, they're the same. And do I know the
relationship between time? Yes, I do. So I can use this to find the relationship between the accelerations. It'll be a great idea to pause the video and see if you can try this on your own. Very similar to what we did earlier. All right, let's do this. So we can write down the accelerations for both the missions. So for B it'll be two times
delta XB by tB square, and for A will be two
delta XA by tA square. But we know delta XB and
delta XA are exactly the same, so we can just get rid
of A and B over there. And we can divide the
two just like before. And then simplify. So the two delta X and two
delta X can divide out. That leaving us with one over tB square, divide by one over tA square. And then we can rearrange
this to get tA square divided by tB square. And again, we can finally
plug in what tB is, tB is 1/2 tA. If we plug that in over here, we get 1/2 tA, the whole squared. Finally, tA square divides out, leaving us with one divided
by 1 over 4, which is 4. So from this, I now know that the acceleration in Mission B would be four times as the
acceleration in Mission A. And so there we have it. We need four times more acceleration here, compared to over here. Four times more is 4 times 10, that is 40. And then we could say that, hey, 40 meters per second squared is too much of an acceleration
for humans to withstand. That's not gonna be possible, 'cause we'll be traveling for a long time. And so we could say that
no, we can't do that. Even if we reach in half the
time, that's not possible. But anyways, just like before, could we have figured this out
without doing the whole math? And the answer is again, yes. Again, if you look at the model carefully, we see that delta X is
the same for both of them, which means acceleration
will be proportional to 1 over t squared, or inversely proportional to t squared. This means whatever factor t changes by, acceleration will change by
the reciprocal of the square. So if t were to double, acceleration would be the
reciprocal 1/2 square, 1/4. If t were to triple,
acceleration would change by one over three reciprocal square, 1/9. But in our case, t became half. So acceleration would be
reciprocal two square, four. And there you have it. This is a very powerful way of doing this. Since we are having so much fun over here, we should try one more plan, Mission C. Here, we'll keep the same
acceleration as before, but we'll allow the spacecraft will travel for 50% more time than before. So same acceleration, but 50% more time. It's gonna travel farther, right? And the question is how much farther? So we know what to do by now. Think about our mathematical model. So again, since we're dealing with positions and accelerations, let's use the same model as before. Write down what we know. And at any moment, feel free to pause and try
this on your own, okay? But let's write down what we already know. We know, I mean, we can
set our X0 to be zero, the initial position to be zero, and the final position would just be X. So we can just set X0 to be zero. We also know the V0,
initial velocity, is zero. So we know that. We also know the
accelerations are the same in this time. So acceleration case A
and case C is the same. And we are allowing for 50% more time. So we know that the time here is 50% more, compared to time A,
which means 1.5 times A. So tC must be 1.5 times tA. And again, we can plug
in zeros to simplify. So this goes to zero, this goes to zero. And that gives us a simplified model, X, which is the final
position which we want. That is the model. So let's see if it's useful, okay? We want X, we want to compare that, so it's good that's there. Do we know the relationship
between the accelerations? Yes, the same accelerations. Do we know the relationship
between the time? Yes, we do. So we know the relationship
between time, 1.5 times tA. And so we can figure this out. Again, we can do the math, but we also know how to do
this in a shortcut now, right? So we can look at this model and we can say that, hey, since the acceleration is the same, since A is the same, X is directly proportional to t squared. So now whatever factor t changes by, X will change by the
square of that factor. You can see that's directly
proportional this time, right? So if t doubles, X will be, X will change by a factor of two square, if t triples, X will change
by a factor of three square. In our case, t has become 1.5 times more. So X will change by a
factor of 1.5 squared. So we can immediately write XC, the final position over here, okay, that has to be 1.5 times square XA, the final position over here. And if you simplify, 1.5 square is 2.25. And so we immediately get the answer. So XC would be 2.25 times XA, which is amazing if you
think about it, right? Just by 50% more time, it'll travel more than twice the distance, compared to the first one. And by the way, we can check the math, and I'll not go through
all the steps over here. I'll just show you all the steps. You can pause the video

by 1 over 4, which is 4. So from this, I now know that the acceleration in Mission B would be four times as the
acceleration in Mission A. And so there we have it. We need four times more acceleration here, compared to over here. Four times more is 4 times 10, that is 40. And then we could say that, hey, 40 meters per second squared is too much of an acceleration

accelerations are the same in this time. So acceleration case A
and case C is the same. And we are allowing for 50% more time. So we know that the time here is 50% more, compared to time A,
which means 1.5 times A. So tC must be 1.5 times tA. And again, we can plug
in zeros to simplify. So this goes to zero, this goes to zero. And that gives us a simplified model, X, which is the final
position which we want. That is the model. So let's see if it's useful, okay? We want X, we want to compare that, so it's good that's there. Do we know the relationship
between the accelerations? Yes, the same accelerations. Do we know the relationship
between the time? Yes, we do. So we know the relationship
between time, 1.5 times tA. And so we can figure this out. Again, we can do the math, but we also know how to do
this in a shortcut now, right? So we can look at this model and we can say that, hey, since the acceleration is the same, since A is the same, X is directly proportional to t squared. So now whatever factor t changes by, X will change by the
square of that factor. You can see that's directly
proportional this time, right? So if t doubles, X will be, X will change by a factor of two square, if t triples, X will change
by a factor of three square. In our case, t has become 1.5 times more. So X will change by a
factor of 1.5 squared. So we can immediately write XC, the final position over here, okay, that has to be 1.5 times square XA, the final position over here. And if you simplify, 1.5 square is 2.25. And so we immediately get the answer. So XC would be 2.25 times XA, which is amazing if you
think about it, right? Just by 50% more time, it'll travel more than twice the distance, compared to the first one. And by the way, we can check the math, and I'll not go through
all the steps over here. I'll just show you all the steps. You can pause the video
and you can just see, if you divide it and, you
know, do it the long way, you get the same answer. But anyways, look at what this means. This means that, you
know, in the first case, if we allowed it to travel for one year, and let's say the distance it traveled was a billion kilometers, in the second case, if we
allow it 50% more time, which is 1 1/2 years, it will travel 2.25 billion kilometers. That's awesome. So, long story short, by using mathematical models, we can see how changing one variable affects the other variable. This is super useful
in comparing scenarios. What's important is that you
don't need actual values, you just need the models
and you can divide them out, and you can figure out, and you can compare, you know, whatever you want to compare. And another way is you can
do it without dividing, you can do it without doing the math, by just looking at the model, seeing what variables are
the same for them both, and then figuring out the
proportionality relationship, the right proportionality relationship. If you know the factor by

Program design: deck of cards | Intro to CS - Python | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxZJNHxTGeo,"- [Instructor] Let's design a program with functions and nested function calls. We wanna build a program that lets the user play
several different card games. That means every game is going to need to share functionality for
dealing a deck of playing cards. The first thing that comes to mind is that I'll probably want a function that can draw a random card from the deck. I'm thinking I probably wanna
represent a card as a string, so this might return something
like queen of hearts. For now, I'm gonna go ahead and stick that in as a placeholder return value. The other task I can see
wanting to perform over and over again is drawing a hand of cards. Different games use different hand sizes, so I'll want this to be generalizable. So the function should take in as a parameter the
number of cards in the hand. Okay, so how should this function work? I guess really what I
want is to draw a number of cards equal to that parameter. Maybe I accumulate all
of those card strings into one giant string and
then return that at the end. That sounds like a good
use case for a loop. On each iteration, I draw a
card and then I concatenate that card to our hand. Before we get ahead of
ourselves, let's test out what we did so far by calling draw hand, and to be safe, let's test it out with a few different arguments. Ooh, okay. That's a little hard to read. What if instead I put each
card on a separate line? In Python, we can achieve this
with a new line character, which is just a backslash followed by N. Instead of displaying this as it appears, Python interprets this, essentially, as us hitting the enter key. So now with my hand nicely
formatted, I feel confident that my draw hand function works, but I don't want my hand to
be full of queens every time. So it's time to go back in and fill in our draw card function. A playing card consists of two pieces, the suit and the rank. To draw a random card then,
I wanna pick a random suit and random rank, which sounds
like two different tasks, which means two different functions. Let's start out with the suit, since that only has four options, and we'll import the random
module at the top of the file. Okay, well, we want this
function to return either hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs
with equal likelihood. So we'll generate a random
number between one and four, and based on that number,
choose which suit to return. Then we can go back to the
draw card function and replace that hard-coded hearts
with a call to get suit. When I run those draw
hand function calls now, I get all different kinds of queens. The last thing we need to
add is a get rank function. A playing card can have a rank of ace, two through 10, or jack, queen, king. That means, in total, there
are 13 possible ranks. So we'll generate a
number between one and 13. If we get one, we'll return the rank ace, 11 will return jack,
12, queen, and 13, king. Any other rank like
eight is just represented by its number, so we can return num. Now, just like before,
let's go back to draw card, and call get rank. Mm. What does this stack trace mean? When we read stack traces
that involve function calls, we generally wanna focus on the bottom because that is what'll tell
us what the actual error is and what line it came from. The rest of the stack trace
just tells us the path of execution the computer
took to reach that line. So it started by executing draw hand, which then called draw card,
which then had the error. This type error tells us that we're adding an integer and a string. So get rank must be
returning an integer somehow. These cases are definitely
returning a string. Mm, but down here, when we
return num, num is an integer. As a general rule, a
function should be consistent about which data type it returns, always. That way callers can know what to expect. So since get rank needs to return a string in the ace, jack, queen, king
case, we also wanna cast num to a string, before we return it. There's one last feature we wanna add. Some of our card games
don't use face cards, that is, ace, jack, queen, king. Because face cards can either
be enabled or disabled, we can support this option
with a boolean parameter. And if we don't want face cards, we can just generate a random number between two and 10 instead,
that way we're excluding the options one, 11, 12, and 13. Now, when I call get
rank inside draw card, I'll need to pass that
parameter, but how do I know if it should be true or false? Well, I don't know. I wanna
let the caller decide. So draw card, we'll
also take that parameter and pass it through to get rank, and then that extends
to draw hand as well. Oops! And now I need to update
my calls to draw hand to take in that extra argument. Now that it's all working, what are the limitations of this approach? Well, the deck I modeled
here isn't actually stateful. It's possible my hand
has two ace of spades. Depending on our use case, this
might actually be a feature because some games use multiple decks or don't want players to count cards. But in other games where the
rules strictly assume exactly one of each card, this might be a bug. For this collection of games, I actually think the
simplification is pretty nice, but it might not be for
someone else's use case.",Creating a Program with Functions and Nested Function Calls,The instructor discusses the design of a program that will allow users to play various card games.,00:00:00 - 00:06:00,2024-10-03T02:04:45Z,9007,154,2

Developing kinematic equations from data | Physics | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr39gKnviAc,"- [Instructor] How do we
figure out how big a runway we need so that the plane that's landing, for
example, can stop safely? Or imagine there's an asteroid that's hurling towards the Earth. Don't worry, it's not gonna hit the Earth. It's gonna come very close by, but again, how do we figure
out how long it would take to come close to the Earth so that we can be
prepared to see it, right? Well, this requires us
to predict the future and one of the ways to do that is by building what we
call mathematical models, but what exactly are they and how do we do that? Well, let's find out. The best way to learn what this is is by taking a concrete example. Now these are pretty complex so let's take a much simpler example, an example in which an object is moving with a constant or uniform acceleration. For example, here's a demo. We can take a toy car
on a ramp, let it go, and that'll be in a uniform
acceleration, right? And we can now measure its positions, and times, and velocities and let's say here's the sample data. So for different values of position, we have recorded the times at which that position was reached and we've also recorded the velocity. A question we could ask is how exactly is
velocity related to time? Answering that question is what we call building a mathematical model. But wait a second, isn't that just building an equation? Yes, mathematical models are equations, but they're not any equations. They're equations that connect physical quantities, physical,
measurable quantities. So equations that connect
measurable quantities are what we call mathematical model. So how do we get a mathematical model that connects velocity and time? Well, for that, we can plot
a graph of velocity and time. We can choose time as
our independent variable because its passage is
not controlled by anything and we'll consider velocity
as the dependent variable. Dependent variable is usually
drawn on the vertical. The independent variable
is drawn on the horizontal, so let's plot that graph. So here's a graph. This is what we get and you can see that this graph is pretty much a straight line. So whenever a graph is a straight line, we say it's a linear graph and the beauty of linear graphs is that this means that
these two quantities become proportional to each other. So in this case, we can say that velocity
is proportional to time. Now what is the meaning of that? Well, this means if the
time changes by some factor, velocity will also change
by the same factor. So let's see that actually
in the graph, okay? So consider time changing
from zero to one. All right, so here it is, time changing from zero to one second. Let's see how much the velocity changes. The velocity starts with 20. You can see over here
that's the initial velocity. 20.4, roughly 20, okay? And from here, it changes to, let's see how much it changes to, it changes to 38. So the change in the velocity over here is 18 centimeters per second. So when the time changes by one second,, velocity changes by 18
centimeters per second. Okay, now let's consider what happens if the time changed by two seconds, so from here to here. So let's do that over here. So now the time has
changed by two seconds. Let's see how much the
velocity changes by. Again, it starts with 20 and it goes till here, and that is about 56. You can see the halfway is 50 and this is somewhere in between, so it's about 56. And again, how much has this changed? From 20 to 56, we'll subtract the two, you get 36. So the velocity this
time has changed by 36 and this has to be centimeters per second, and this is two seconds. And now you can clearly see that when the time changed
by a factor of two, look, the velocity also
changed by a factor of two. If the time had changed
by a factor of three, the velocity would've
changed by a factor of three and so on and so forth. That's what it means to be proportional. When one quantity changes by some factor, the other quantity also
changes by the same factor. Okay, now how do we build a model or an equation that
connects velocity and time? Well, we know the equation
to a straight line. An equation to a straight
line is y equals mx plus b where b is the y-intercept and m represents the slope. Now let's say we know
the values of the slope and this slope represents
the rise over the run, and we have these values. It's 18 divided by one or you can do that over here, 36 divided by two which is 18. So we know m is 18 and b is the y-intercept that's over here. You can see that's about 20, that's 20.4, but we can just round it off and just call that as 20. Values are not really important over here. Our goal is to build a model, right? So we get y equals 18x plus 20, but now let's see what
these numbers represent. y represents our velocity, so this will be our velocity. What does 18 represent? Well, look at the units. It's 18 centimeters per second. Per second, that's a slope, right? That is centimeters per second squared. That is your acceleration, okay? That is the acceleration. So 18 here represents the acceleration, x represents the time, and what is this 20? This 20 represents the initial velocity. Velocity when time was zero, so we can call that as v0, and there we have it. This is the mathematical model that connects velocity and time. And now if we knew what
the acceleration was and the initial velocity was, then I can use this to predict the future. If that object continued with
the same constant acceleration and if you input the value of time, I can then figure out
what would be the value of the velocity at that particular time, predicting the future
using mathematical models. Pretty cool, right? Let's try to build another model. This time let's ask ourselves what is the connection
between position and time? And again, we can plot this time the graph of position and time. This time position will be dependent, time will be independent, and the graph we get looks like this. What's interesting is that
this is not a linear graph. In fact, this is a quadratic graph. We call this a parabola. So now one way to build a
model for position and time is to try and write an
equation for a parabola, but for that, we now have to remember the equation for the parabola and we have to think about which kind of parabola it
is and stuff like that. So we can go ahead and do that, but here's another way to
think about this, okay? So let me go back to
the velocity time graph that we had plotted. You may recall that the area
under the velocity time graph, that represents the displacement. So this means if I figure
out what this area is, then I can build an equation
for the position and the time. So it'll be a great
idea to pause the video and see if you can try to
find the area of this graph and see if you can figure
out what the model would be that connects position and time. Okay, let's do this. There are multiple ways to
calculate the area of this graph, but what I like to do is divide
this graph into two parts. We can see a rectangle and a triangle. Well, now let's think about the sides. Well, this represents our velocity 'cause this is a velocity axis. This represents the time because it's the time axis. This side represents the initial velocity. Does that make sense? So from this, we could write delta x which is the displacement, that is the area under the graph. That equals the area of this rectangle which is v-naught times t plus the area of this triangle which is 1/2 times base which is t times height. Height, this height would
be v minus v-naught. All right, we have a model but we can simplify it further. v minus v-naught we can
see from here is just at. So let me just take a copy of this and substitute this as at, giving us 1/2at squared, and finally, what is delta x? Delta x is displacement which is change in position, which is final position
minus the initial position. So let's do that. And then finally, rearranging this gives me the required model. It's a model that connects
position and time. And now if you look at this model, we can see that here we no
longer have a linear equation. We have a quadratic equation. That's nice 'cause it's
exactly what we saw. It was not a linear graph. It was a quadratic graph and we were getting a parabola. But what's interesting now
is in this particular case, what if the initial velocity was zero? So in our case, it's not, but what if we had a different kind of motion
with constant acceleration in which the initial
velocity was zero, okay? Then this thing would
reduce to x equals x-naught. This would be zero plus 1/2at squared, and what's interesting about this is that this is also of
the form y equals mx plus b provided the horizontal axis
is not t, but t squared. In other words, if you plot a graph of position where it
says t, that's a parabola because this is quadratic. But if in this special case, we drew the graph of
position and t squared, that would be a straight line. And so for this particular case, not ours, but in this particular case, we could have derived this model by drawing a graph of
position and time squared, drawing a straight line, and then figuring out
what the slope would be and the intercept would be, and that's how we could have derived this
mathematical model. So over here notice we would get position to be proportional to not
time, but time squared, and this method where we clearly
pick the axis in such a way as to get a linear graph is
what we call linearization. Anyways since we're having so much fun, let's do one more model where we connect position and velocity. So again, we'll plot a graph, we will take position as our
independent variable this time, and we'll take velocity
as our dependent variable so it'll be along the vertical. Position will be along the horizontal. Let's see what the graph looks like and we get a graph that looks
like this if we plot them all. You can see it's not a straight line and again, it looks like a parabola. So here's how we can think about it. Because this is on its side, see, velocity is not
proportional to position. It's not growing as quickly. It's growing much more slowly, so it's not proportional to position. It's a square root graph. So in this particular case, velocity is proportional to
the square root of position or we can get rid of square roots. I don't like square roots. We could say velocity squared
is proportional to position. So this is an attempt at linearization which means let's try to plot the graph of velocity squared versus position and let's see if we get a straight line. If we get a straight line, that's great, linearization worked. If not, we'll probably
need to troubleshoot and figure out other ways to linearize it. But anyways let's see if this works, so we need to now look
at velocity squared. So we can add one more
column where we square these, so let's do that. Here it is, so we just
squared these values and now let's take a plot of
velocity square versus position and see what we get, here we go. Oh, we indeed get a straight line. You can clearly see it's
a beautiful straight line. So velocity squared versus position gives us a straight line. Linearization worked, so
this is indeed working. So now, so we can now write the equation of the straight line and simplify and see what the model is. Great idea to pause the video and see if you can try it yourself first. All right, so going back the
equation to a straight line, y equals mx plus b. We know what t is. That's our velocity squared. We know what x is, that's our position. We know what b is. b is this y-intercept which is the initial velocity squared. The big question is what is m? Well, let's look at the value and try to figure that out. So we can do rise over run. If I consider 40 centimeters, then the rise over here would be subtracting these two values which I got from here. These two values which
is 1,444 centimeters squared per second square. So the slope would be this divided by this and if we do that, we get roughly 36 centimeters
per second squared. First of all, this is
the acceleration units, so this must be having
units of acceleration. So there must be acceleration over here, and then last time we
found the acceleration was 18 centimeter per second square. So that means this is
twice the acceleration, so this represents twice the acceleration. So we can now write all
of those things down. This is velocity squared. This is twice the acceleration, so 2a. Then we get the position plus b and b is our initial velocity squared because this is the velocity squared axis which is v-naught squared. If we rearrange this, we get this and then finally, remember that actually x is the displacement. That happens because our
initial position was zero. If it was not zero, then we should replace
this with x minus x-naught. And there we have it, the final mathematical model that connects velocity and position. These three models are what we
call the kinematic equations and they're extremely
useful for predicting stuff when we are dealing with motions that have constant acceleration.",Mathematical Models,Mathematical models are equations that connect measurable physical quantities.,00:00:00 - 00:04:23,2024-10-01T20:29:53Z,8722,153,4

velocity related to time? Answering that question is what we call building a mathematical model. But wait a second, isn't that just building an equation? Yes, mathematical models are equations, but they're not any equations. They're equations that connect physical quantities, physical,
measurable quantities. So equations that connect
measurable quantities are what we call mathematical model. So how do we get a mathematical model that connects velocity and time? Well, for that, we can plot
a graph of velocity and time. We can choose time as
our independent variable because its passage is
not controlled by anything and we'll consider velocity
as the dependent variable. Dependent variable is usually
drawn on the vertical. The independent variable
is drawn on the horizontal, so let's plot that graph. So here's a graph. This is what we get and you can see that this graph is pretty much a straight line. So whenever a graph is a straight line, we say it's a linear graph and the beauty of linear graphs is that this means that
these two quantities become proportional to each other. So in this case, we can say that velocity
is proportional to time. Now what is the meaning of that? Well, this means if the
time changes by some factor, velocity will also change
by the same factor. So let's see that actually
in the graph, okay? So consider time changing
from zero to one. All right, so here it is, time changing from zero to one second. Let's see how much the velocity changes. The velocity starts with 20. You can see over here
that's the initial velocity. 20.4, roughly 20, okay? And from here, it changes to, let's see how much it changes to, it changes to 38. So the change in the velocity over here is 18 centimeters per second. So when the time changes by one second,, velocity changes by 18
centimeters per second. Okay, now let's consider what happens if the time changed by two seconds, so from here to here. So let's do that over here. So now the time has
changed by two seconds. Let's see how much the
velocity changes by. Again, it starts with 20 and it goes till here, and that is about 56. You can see the halfway is 50 and this is somewhere in between, so it's about 56. And again, how much has this changed? From 20 to 56, we'll subtract the two, you get 36. So the velocity this
time has changed by 36 and this has to be centimeters per second, and this is two seconds. And now you can clearly see that when the time changed
by a factor of two, look, the velocity also
changed by a factor of two. If the time had changed
by a factor of three, the velocity would've
changed by a factor of three and so on and so forth. That's what it means to be proportional. When one quantity changes by some factor, the other quantity also
changes by the same factor. Okay, now how do we build a model or an equation that
connects velocity and time? Well, we know the equation
to a straight line. An equation to a straight
line is y equals mx plus b where b is the y-intercept and m represents the slope. Now let's say we know
the values of the slope and this slope represents
the rise over the run, and we have these values. It's 18 divided by one or you can do that over here, 36 divided by two which is 18. So we know m is 18 and b is the y-intercept that's over here. You can see that's about 20, that's 20.4, but we can just round it off and just call that as 20. Values are not really important over here. Our goal is to build a model, right? So we get y equals 18x plus 20, but now let's see what
these numbers represent. y represents our velocity, so this will be our velocity. What does 18 represent? Well, look at the units. It's 18 centimeters per second. Per second, that's a slope, right? That is centimeters per second squared. That is your acceleration, okay? That is the acceleration. So 18 here represents the acceleration, x represents the time, and what is this 20? This 20 represents the initial velocity. Velocity when time was zero, so we can call that as v0, and there we have it. This is the mathematical model that connects velocity and time. And now if we knew what
the acceleration was and the initial velocity was, then I can use this to predict the future. If that object continued with
the same constant acceleration and if you input the value of time, I can then figure out
what would be the value of the velocity at that particular time, predicting the future
using mathematical models. Pretty cool, right? Let's try to build another model. This time let's ask ourselves what is the connection
between position and time? And again, we can plot this time the graph of position and time. This time position will be dependent, time will be independent, and the graph we get looks like this. What's interesting is that
this is not a linear graph. In fact, this is a quadratic graph. We call this a parabola. So now one way to build a
model for position and time is to try and write an
equation for a parabola, but for that, we now have to remember the equation for the parabola and we have to think about which kind of parabola it
is and stuff like that. So we can go ahead and do that, but here's another way to
think about this, okay? So let me go back to
the velocity time graph that we had plotted. You may recall that the area
under the velocity time graph, that represents the displacement. So this means if I figure
out what this area is, then I can build an equation
for the position and the time. So it'll be a great
idea to pause the video and see if you can try to
find the area of this graph and see if you can figure
out what the model would be that connects position and time. Okay, let's do this. There are multiple ways to
calculate the area of this graph, but what I like to do is divide
this graph into two parts. We can see a rectangle and a triangle. Well, now let's think about the sides. Well, this represents our velocity 'cause this is a velocity axis. This represents the time because it's the time axis. This side represents the initial velocity. Does that make sense? So from this, we could write delta x which is the displacement, that is the area under the graph. That equals the area of this rectangle which is v-naught times t plus the area of this triangle which is 1/2 times base which is t times height. Height, this height would
be v minus v-naught. All right, we have a model but we can simplify it further. v minus v-naught we can
see from here is just at. So let me just take a copy of this and substitute this as at, giving us 1/2at squared, and finally, what is delta x? Delta x is displacement which is change in position, which is final position
minus the initial position. So let's do that. And then finally, rearranging this gives me the required model. It's a model that connects
position and time. And now if you look at this model, we can see that here we no
longer have a linear equation. We have a quadratic equation. That's nice 'cause it's
exactly what we saw. It was not a linear graph. It was a quadratic graph and we were getting a parabola. But what's interesting now
is in this particular case, what if the initial velocity was zero? So in our case, it's not, but what if we had a different kind of motion
with constant acceleration in which the initial
velocity was zero, okay? Then this thing would
reduce to x equals x-naught. This would be zero plus 1/2at squared, and what's interesting about this is that this is also of
the form y equals mx plus b provided the horizontal axis
is not t, but t squared. In other words, if you plot a graph of position where it
says t, that's a parabola because this is quadratic. But if in this special case, we drew the graph of
position and t squared, that would be a straight line. And so for this particular case, not ours, but in this particular case, we could have derived this model by drawing a graph of
position and time squared, drawing a straight line, and then figuring out
what the slope would be and the intercept would be, and that's how we could have derived this
mathematical model. So over here notice we would get position to be proportional to not
time, but time squared, and this method where we clearly
pick the axis in such a way as to get a linear graph is
what we call linearization. Anyways since we're having so much fun, let's do one more model where we connect position and velocity. So again, we'll plot a graph, we will take position as our
independent variable this time, and we'll take velocity
as our dependent variable so it'll be along the vertical. Position will be along the horizontal. Let's see what the graph looks like and we get a graph that looks
like this if we plot them all. You can see it's not a straight line and again, it looks like a parabola. So here's how we can think about it. Because this is on its side, see, velocity is not
proportional to position. It's not growing as quickly. It's growing much more slowly, so it's not proportional to position. It's a square root graph. So in this particular case, velocity is proportional to
the square root of position or we can get rid of square roots. I don't like square roots. We could say velocity squared
is proportional to position. So this is an attempt at linearization which means let's try to plot the graph of velocity squared versus position and let's see if we get a straight line. If we get a straight line, that's great, linearization worked. If not, we'll probably
need to troubleshoot and figure out other ways to linearize it. But anyways let's see if this works, so we need to now look
at velocity squared. So we can add one more
column where we square these, so let's do that. Here it is, so we just
squared these values and now let's take a plot of
velocity square versus position and see what we get, here we go. Oh, we indeed get a straight line. You can clearly see it's
a beautiful straight line. So velocity squared versus position gives us a straight line. Linearization worked, so
this is indeed working. So now, so we can now write the equation of the straight line and simplify and see what the model is. Great idea to pause the video and see if you can try it yourself first. All right, so going back the
equation to a straight line, y equals mx plus b. We know what t is. That's our velocity squared. We know what x is, that's our position. We know what b is. b is this y-intercept which is the initial velocity squared. The big question is what is m? Well, let's look at the value and try to figure that out. So we can do rise over run. If I consider 40 centimeters, then the rise over here would be subtracting these two values which I got from here. These two values which
is 1,444 centimeters squared per second square. So the slope would be this divided by this and if we do that, we get roughly 36 centimeters
per second squared. First of all, this is
the acceleration units, so this must be having
units of acceleration. So there must be acceleration over here, and then last time we
found the acceleration was 18 centimeter per second square. So that means this is
twice the acceleration, so this represents twice the acceleration. So we can now write all
of those things down. This is velocity squared. This is twice the acceleration, so 2a. Then we get the position plus b and b is our initial velocity squared because this is the velocity squared axis which is v-naught squared. If we rearrange this, we get this and then finally, remember that actually x is the displacement. That happens because our
initial position was zero. If it was not zero, then we should replace
this with x minus x-naught. And there we have it, the final mathematical model that connects velocity and position. These three models are what we
call the kinematic equations and they're extremely
useful for predicting stuff when we are dealing with motions that have constant acceleration.",Linear Relationships,A linear graph represents a proportional relationship between two variables.,00:04:23 - 00:05:57,2024-10-01T20:29:53Z,8722,153,4
Nested function calls | Intro to CS - Python | Khan Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1oqBxBWRQ4,"- [Instructor] Can I call a function from inside another function? Let's trace what happens, and explore why we might wanna
organize our code this way. When we call a function from
the top level of a program, we create a new stack frame and store all our local variables there. When we later return
from that function call, we pop off our stack frame and pass our return
value back to the caller. If a function calls another function within its function body, we just do the same thing, but we're going one level deeper. When execution reaches
that inner function call, the computer pauses what it's doing, loads that function's instructions, and then goes off to execute them. This creates a new stack frame on top of our existing stack frame. Our existing stack frame stays where it is because we're not done
executing that function yet. It hasn't returned. The computer needs to preserve that state so we can go back and finish
executing the function later. Any parameters or variables
that are a part of this function gets stored on that new top stack frame. When we reach this
function's return statement, we exit out, pop off that top stack frame, and return back to where
that function was called, which in this case, was
inside another function. Notice that the top stack frame now, which is the one that's accessible, is the one that has the
state for this function call. And then, the computer picks
up execution of this function where it left off. We can, in theory, go as
many levels deep as we want. Every time the computer calls a function, it creates a new stack
frame on the very top. And every time the computer
returns from a function call, it pops off the top stack frame. That way, each stack frame is keeping track of the variables local to a specific function call. If we need to pass information through that pipeline of function calls, we can just use the function parameters. We can pass it as an argument
to the first function call, which can then pass it as an argument to the inner function call. Okay, but why might we
nest a function call in the first place? Let's set the scene. Imagine a video game where players try to sneak into a building without being detected by the guards. Your chance of detection depends on the volume of your footsteps and the volume of your footsteps depends on how fast you're moving and the environment you're in. You can be super quiet
crouching in the grass, or you can be super loud running on metal. Now here's one way to solve that problem. I have one giant function that takes in as parameters the player's movement
type and environment. And then, it turns out a Boolean that tells us whether the
player has been detected. I can now call this
function across my game anytime a player is sneaking around. So what's the problem then? Well, it's true that I
technically have a function, but this function body is huge. Within one function, I'm performing several different tasks. First, I calculate the
player's footstep volume based on their movement. Then, I adjust that volume based on the environment they're in. And then, I compare that volume against a random detection threshold. When a function does a
lot of different things, it makes the program harder to read because it's not always
obvious from the function name all of the things that
that giant function does. Two, it makes it harder to test. If I pass in as arguments walk and metal and the function returns true, well, did it work? I don't know what that
final value of volume was that it compared against the threshold. So it's hard to say whether that return
value true makes sense, or there's some bug hiding
in my function body. And three, it makes the
code harder to reuse. If every function performs only one task, then I can mix and match
the functionality as I need. So how do we fix this? We just break it down into
several smaller functions. So first, let's separate
out this movement task. We wanna take in a base
volume and movement type and return out the adjusted volume. So we'll copy this conditional
into our function body and return the volume. Then, inside this wrapper
is_detected function, we can delete this conditional and replace it with a function call. Notice that this smaller function
is very easy to test now. Because my function is
doing one specific task, it's easy for me to gut check that my return values make sense. If I call it with the argument crouch, I should get a smaller volume. And if I call it with the argument run, I should get a bigger volume. Then, I can just do that same thing with the environment conditional. I separate it out into a smaller function that takes in a volume
and an environment type, and then returns out the adjusted volume. Then, I can come back here
and nest that function call. Notice that these function names describe the tasks that they perform. So we don't really need
these comments anymore. Our function names are self-documenting. Now for the detection check: I could nest a third function call here, but in this case, I think
it might actually be better to separate out this
functionality entirely. There's really no reason
why this volume calculation needs to be tied to this threshold check. So I can instead have a wrapper
get_footstep_volume function that takes in the movement and environment and returns out the volume. That now lets me have a nice reusable, independent is_detected
function that takes in a volume and returns out a Boolean. Okay, we've seen how this makes
our program easier to test and easier to read. But how about this reusability benefit? If I wanna now add a feature where say the player's voice
can also give them away, I have these functions in place to make that really easy. A voice would also be
modified by the environment, so I can reuse my environment function without having to think twice about it. And then, since I decoupled
that detection threshold check, I can calculate my voice volume and then conveniently just plug it in to the is_detected function. To build that whole feature, I had to do very little work because I solved most of
those problems already. So the next time you're writing a program, think about breaking it
down into small functions that each perform a specific task. Then, when you need to
combine functionality to perform a bigger task, you can always nest those function calls in a wrapper function.",Function Nesting,"Function nesting involves calling a function from within the body of another function, creating multiple stack frames to track local variables.",00:00:00 - 00:02:30,2024-10-01T01:37:29Z,6772,168,3

where people can disagree, but they can disagree in respectful ways, and we actually all benefit
from that disagreement. So I think you're probably
as excited as I am now to jump into this course. So let's get started. Jump in, start watching some videos, start reading some articles. Start taking some of those exercises, those unit tests, those course challenges. And hopefully you're
gonna get just as excited about our Constitution and our democracy as myself and Jeff are.",The Diverse Perspectives on the Constitution,The Constitution is a complex document that has been interpreted in different ways by different people.,00:03:00 - 00:05:00,2024-09-27T19:15:13Z,7756,277,12
How to Use Khan Academy's Free Courses for Texas Teachers and Students,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SxJXClDJcw,"- To share valuable free
resources with you today that I believe will not
only benefit your students, but also lighten your load as you manage the many, many decisions and tasks that come along with teaching nowadays. I really truly appreciate
everything that you do, and I hope that these
tools that we discuss today and these resources will
help simplify your workflow and give you more time to focus on what really matters most, right? All right. So for today, we'll be exploring the Khan Academy platform together. We're gonna start with
the teacher dashboard and the newly added TEKS-aligned courses, which also come with a downloadable, printable teachers guide. And we're also going to
introduce you to Khanmigo, your AI-powered teaching assistant. And before we wrap up, we'll also go over some practical ways that
you can start integrating Khan Academy into your
classroom right away to complement your existing instruction and all of the great things
that are already going on. So we also have joining us
today from Khan Academy, Jennifer Nav-iv, who will be supporting by answering your questions in the chat. So please feel free to ask away. And as a reminder, we are
recording this webinar. We will be sending it out
to anyone who registers so that you can revisit this
information anytime you need. And at the end, we'll also
include the information of our help center where
you can also get answers to your questions. So before we get started,
I'd like to introduce your dedicated Khan Academy Texas team. We are all based right here in Texas and are committed to supporting
districts and schools throughout our Khan
Academy Districts program. Now, while districts do have
the option to partner with us for additional benefits
like automatic rostering, professional development,
data and reporting, as well as ongoing implementation support, today we'll be focusing
exclusively on the free resources that are always available
to all educators. Oh, you know what? Went a slide too far back. So if could just quickly
check in with everyone. And if you could please
drop a one, two, or three in the chat to let us know how familiar you are with Khan Academy, where one means that
you're just starting out, you haven't really ever
been on the platform, don't really know much about it. Two means that you have some experience, and three means that you're
very familiar with our platform. So if you could just take a minute to please go ahead and
drop that in the chat. And while you're doing
that, I'm going to go ahead and talk to you a little bit
about what is Khan Academy. And we are a nonprofit organization. Our mission is to provide free world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We do this through our online platform. We offer personalized learning
experiences for students, grades second and up is the platform that we're gonna be exploring today. We also have Khan Kids available as an app for our little ones. And we do focus on mastery learning, allowing students to
progress at their own pace and ensuring that they fully
understand each concept before moving on, because our
goal is to empower learners and help them reach that grade
level mastery and beyond. So I'd like to, before we
go live into the platform, take a moment to explore this
concept of mastery learning, which is at the
cornerstone of Khan Academy and how Khan Academy is structured. As I said, we embrace mastery
learning, this approach, because it ensures that
students fully understand a skill or concept before
they move on to the next one. And this method not only fosters a deep understanding, but it also is supported
by robust evidence showing its effectiveness and improving the long-term retention
of skills and knowledge. And it does this by providing
thorough understanding in combination with timely feedback and pacing that is
appropriate for the learner and where that learner is at, while embedding those strategic
scaffolds along the way. And especially here in Texas, you know, this type of
approach is essential for success on assessments
like STAAR, TSIA2, and of course the SAT for
our high schoolers as well. So to illustrate this further,
let's take a look at this brief video that explains
mastery learning in more detail. - [Announcer] Have you ever
really tried to learn something and you just couldn't? It can make you feel like
you're not so smart, right? Well, it's not your fault and it's not your teacher's fault, it's just our traditional
approach to learning. We go through school
and we accumulate gaps. You're a bit shaky on pre-algebra, but you move on to algebra anyway. By the time you get to calculus,
you've got lots of gaps. If enough gaps build up,
you'll eventually hit a wall. Calculus makes no sense. And that can be frustrating. But what if there were a
different way to learn? That's mastery learning. Unlike traditional
learning where all students move in lockstep, with mastery learning, you go at your own pace. You progress through questions at just the right level for you. If you get 50% right the first
time, it's not a big deal. Try as many times as you need. Get feedback as you learn
and help you need it. Features can track your progress, identify any gaps and give
you one-on-one attention. Decades of research shows
mastery learning works. Now you have the tools
to make it possible. Are you ready to learn anything? - All right. So now we're gonna go
ahead and switch over so that we can do some
of the fun exploring right on the platform. All right, let's... Let's go ahead and switch
over to the platform. And there we are. All right, so we're
gonna go ahead and start. Once you log in, you create your account. You'll see this teacher dashboard. Depending on whether or
not you've added classes, you may or may not see this class section. But we're gonna go through
how you can add courses. The first thing you wanna
do is you wanna come here to the Explore section. The Explore section is going
to give you this dropdown that has the list of all
of our course offerings that are available to
you and to your students. As you can see, we offer
a wide range of courses. Couple things that I wanna note here. The SAT, the digital
SAT test prep courses, these have been widely
utilized across the US for many years because we
are the official partners with College Board. So with the digital SAT, they or your selves could come. Here we have the digital SAT Math. We also have the digital
SAT Reading and Writing as two separate recourse. The domains are broken into foundations, and then the questions get
harder with the medium level and then all the way into advanced. So that is one that I wanted
to make sure to point out because it is very popular here in Texas with our teachers and our students. All of the courses are designed to complement your
grade level instruction. So they offer activities
that encourage students to think deeply. They can access various
instructional materials within the courses to help
scaffold that learning and help support them as
they go through the practices and the exercises. These include videos, the
famous videos by Sal Khan that I'm sure a lot of you
have already heard in the past. It also includes articles, and there are also opportunities to check for understanding through
quizzes, unit tests. We also have course
challenges that can be done three times a year if you'd
like, as a beginning of year, middle of year, end of year checkpoint. And those course challenges
are going to give, they're 30 questions,
about 30 to 45 minutes, and they're gonna give students
a sprinkling of questions for the whole course, right? So again, there's definitely various ways that students can check for understanding and you as teachers can
have data and reports on how your students are doing. Additionally, our content is
also available in 24 languages, which this is, I think, an incredible feature and resource, especially for our emergent
bilingual students, right? So if you have emergent bilingual students that maybe you would like
them to see the content in their native language to help support what you're doing in the classroom as they transition to English,
this is another option that you can do as well, assign to those students and have them go through the content in
their native language. So in addition to browsing
by course, as you see here, you can also, for math only,
you can browse by standards. So if you come up here
to Browse By Standards, and select Texas, you now see that we have
alignment from grades second through eighth,
Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, Precalc, Mathematical
Models with Applications, Advanced Quantitative
Reasoning, Discrete Mathematics for Problem Solving,
and Algebraic Reasoning. I'm just gonna go ahead
and select the Algebra I to give you an example
of what this looks like. So here you will see by standard, the standard is written out, and then you have a list of all
the resources and activities that can be assigned to students to help support that standard. So if you know this is
something that you're going to be teaching and you want
to maybe use one of our videos as an opening to your lesson
and show it whole group, or maybe you want to, you
know, strategically assign it to your students for them to complete it during independent class time or homework, this is another way that
you can access the content so that it aligns to
your scope and sequence and to what's happening in your classroom. Here on the left-hand side, you can see all of the courses that this is available for. You can always open up the dropdown so that you're able to see
the standards that are aligned and the activities that go along with it. All right, so now I'm gonna go ahead and shift over to our
new Texas TEKS courses. We're gonna go ahead and take a little bit of a deeper dive into those. And thanks to the Open Doors project and a generous donation that was provided by the ExxonMobil Foundation,
our content team has created courses just for Texas
that align to the TEKS for math in grades five through eight, also Algebra I, as well
as high school biology, high school chemistry
and high school physics. And with the continued
support of ExxonMobil, we do have plans next year
to expand these Texas courses to include third and fourth grade math as well as Algebra II, Geometry, Precalc, middle school chemistry, and integrated sciences
sixth through seventh grade. And then there are plans
to add even more courses for '26, '27. So definitely, you know,
be on the lookout for those as those get added to our platform. So now I'm gonna go ahead and just select one of these courses. I'm gonna go ahead and go
into 5th grade Texas TEKS because there are a number
of additional resources that you're going to find exclusively in these Texas TEKS courses that was done as part of the work that the ExxonMobil grant was
able to provide Khan Academy. So when you open the
courses, all of our courses, does not matter what grade
level or what subject, they're all going to
visually look the same, and they're all gonna structurally
look and feel the same. The flow is gonna be the same. We're gonna have the units for that course on the left-hand side. You as the teacher, are able
to go to each of these unit and, again, assign at the course level, at the unit level or by
individual activities, as you saw earlier with the
videos and the articles. Now here you have these
white boxes, right? And the white boxes represent skills. A white box is a skill that has
not been started yet, right? A student has not interacted
with any type of content for that particular skill. And once the student clicks
on the box or the skill and starts their practice, it's going to take them through exercises that have embedded many
times the specific video or article that will
help support them, right? So if they're in the
problem and they just, you know, they're kind of
struggling, they don't remember, instead of them having to
go, you know, back through the list of units or exercises available, the platform has already, you
know, linked for them here a related content, video or article that they can quickly access. It will open in a new
window so that the student can get that just in
time support they need as they're working
through these exercises. Once students complete
exercises and/or quizzes or unit tests, these
boxes are going to get one of these four colors. They're either going to
get a, like, burnt orange, a lighter orange, a lavender purple, or a dark purple with a crown. So when they get this burnt
orange color box, right, it means that when the
students engaged in problems or quizzes, tests, et cetera,
with that particular skill, they got less than 70% of
those questions correctly. In a familiar, in a light orange, they got 70% or more
correct within that skill. If you see the lavender, the proficient, then that means that they got
100% of the questions correct when practicing that skill. Now you might say to
yourself, ""Wait a minute, but if that's 100%, then what
could possibly be Mastered?"" So Mastered is when they see that skill, they're assessed on that skill in context with other skills, right? So it's a mixed skill assessment, and they still get 100% of the questions for that skill correct? So in Proficient, they're at 100%, but that skill is being
assessed in isolation. With Mastery, they get
100% of that skill correct, but they're seeing that skill
mixed in with other skills. So it's a little bit more difficult because it's now out of context. So what we want to see and
what we want to aim for, right, what our research shows is that students that can reach these purples, at least two purples per week, so two skills to proficiency per week, are going to be on track to accelerate their learning by at least 35%. And in many cases we see, you know, even bigger gains than that. So as you're thinking about, you know, those student data chats
and assigning goals and really trying to engage your students in purposeful learning, what
you really wanna aim for are for students to level
up to these purples, skills to proficient,
at least two per week. And a common question that we
sometimes get from educators is, ""Well, how long do the students need to be on the platform?"" So with Khan Academy, again, you know, mastery learning is our cornerstone. It's not about time, it's
really about the learning that's happening. And so it's difficult to say, you know, give you an exact amount of time. However, what our research has shown is that it typically
takes students anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per
week to reach that minimum of two skills to proficiency. So, you know, you wanna
think about, again, everybody learns at a different
pace and there may be skills that, you know, they're much
more adept in than others. So a good timeframe to have in your mind is providing opportunities
for 30 to 60 minutes per week. And again, that can look a
variety of different ways. It can be assigned as
independent classwork, it can be assigned as homework, but definitely giving
students an an opportunity to engage weekly on the platform. All right, before I move on, are there any questions in
the chat, Jennifer Aviv, that we should address whole group? - [Jennifer] No, we're good at this time. Thank you, Francis.
- Awesome, excellent. Okay, so with that, I wanna go ahead and dive into these special teacher resources that are part of the Texas TEKS courses. You can access them right
here from the home dashboard under Check out our teacher resources. You can also access them at the very end of the left-hand nav menu
here under Teacher resources. And once you select that,
it's going to take you to this landing page,
which is going to give you a guide on how to use the
teacher guides, right? But it's also going to give you access to these downloadable and printable guides that are organized by unit, right? So I'm gonna go ahead and open up Unit 1, Extending whole number operations. It gives you the standards that this guide is going to cover. Once you click on that PDF, it is going to provide you
with objectives, strategies. It's gonna give you common misconceptions. It's gonna link you out to
any that are referenced. Once we scroll down into the
actual unit resources, right, and again, these are all
going to align to the content that's on Khan, so it's
going to tell you here not only the objective
and the teaching tips to help you as your lesson
planning and as you're delivering this instruction in your whole group, but it's also going to
tell you how many videos are available, how many
articles, and how many exercises to support that particular
lesson and standard. And you're also going to have
a Best practices section. It's going to walk you through
with very specific examples as well as like verbiage on
how to think through this, teach this, support
this in your classroom, and give you also links to additional general implementation resources
that you can use to support these standards and this
unit and these lessons in your classroom. So I'm going to go ahead and go back here. I'm gonna go ahead and
just select this unit just so that, again, you can kind of see how it's structured. So now instead of seeing all
the boxes for all the skills and the entire course,
which are 161 skills, you see that information here
underneath Grade 5 Texas TEKS, again, all the courses will have that, now I'm only seeing for that specific unit how many skills are available. So here students would work through these three and then have a quiz after those exercises,
right, for that skill. Then they're gonna work
through this skill. There's two exercises and
then they'll take a quiz. And that is how it's repeated, right? These little lightning
icons represent quizzes after each skill. And at the very end of the unit, they're gonna take the unit test, which is going to give them questions from each of the skills
that they worked through in the unit. Again, the really great
thing about Khan is that you, as the teacher, have the
flexibility to assign course mastery goals. So if you want to, you know,
make sure that the students have a goal to get
through the whole course by the end of the year, you can do that. You can assign by unit if you wanna chunk the material for
them and have it aligned to your scope and sequence. Because maybe unit one for
you is going to be something that you're teaching in January. So that's okay, you can assign
these units out of order, however they best fit with
your scope and sequence and what you're doing in the
classroom to help support you. You're always gonna have
access to the Assign button. From there, you're gonna be able to assign at the class level. So if you wanna assign it to all students, or if you wanna assign it to
a select group of students, you're also able to do that. And you're able to, with anything, also give specific due dates. And that's what would
create that assignment so that the students
then see that information on their dashboards when
they log in as students. All right. Let's see. From here, I'm gonna go ahead and go back. One thing that here, like I said, you can assign the course. Again, you would be able
to select your class and your students. There's a way that you can
provide a link to students so that students can link their accounts to your class. And with that, some of
the additional benefits of adding that information
is that you will get data, and you will get information
on how your students are doing based on things that you
have assigned to your class and to your students. All right, so we're gonna go ahead now and shift over to Khanmigo. Very, very excited to share
with you all things Khanmigo, because this is the new
AI-powered teaching assistant that has been integrated into Khan Academy to help support you as teachers in not only instructional pieces, but also administrative
tasks that we know teachers are asked to do as part of
their everyday workload. So we're gonna look at different ways that you can leverage
Khanmigo to help you. So there's a couple of ways
that you can access Khanmigo. I'm going to show you first one way, and then we will look at the second way that you can do that. The first way is Khanmigo is
always going to be hovering here on the lower right-hand corner anywhere you are in the platform, right? So if you wake Khanmigo
up and initiate Khanmigo from one of our courses or
from somewhere in the platform, it is going to automatically
know where you are, right? So the prompts that it's going to give you are going to be specific to wherever you are on the platform. So I'm going to say that
I'm in Algebraic reasoning. I know that this is coming up. I'm trying to kind of
think through what to do. I can open Khanmigo and I can go ahead and ask it questions directly, or I can use one of
these automated prompts, and Khanmigo will go ahead
and give me information based on what I ask it. One thing that I wanna point
out, a couple of things, here you're going to see this battery. Right now, it says that I'm at 95%. I've been using it quite a bit today. Khanmigo does run on
something called AI tokens. And so there it is sort
of like a battery, right? There's a 24-hour limit. We've never seen the battery run out, at least not up to this point. And we work with Khanmigo every day. But just in case, we wanna just make sure that you guys are aware of that. And it's like Cinderella. It resets nightly. So no worries. If you're ever low, it's okay. The next day you're back to 100%. The other thing that I
want to point out for you are these Leave feedback buttons. You can either leave as a
thumbs up or a thumbs down, and that'll be the end of that. Or you can click on where
it says Leave feedback, and you can be a little bit more detailed with the type of feedback
that you provide. This, there's actually
somebody on our team that this is her job, is
to analyze this feedback. So this does not go somewhere
in a cloud or to a robot or something that nobody ever sees. Like, this feedback actually
goes to a human person, you know, at the Khan Academy team whose job is to make sure
that we are making, you know, improvements and that
we're constantly ensuring that Khanmigo is doing
what it needs to do. So please, you know, don't
ever hesitate to reach out to us via the Leave feedback. Now I wanna go ahead and go
into an actual lesson, right? So here I'm in Understanding factor pairs, again, I can open up Khanmigo. As you can see now that
I'm in a specific skill, Khanmigo's prompts have changed. Now Khanmigo is giving me the option to summarize this video,
help me explain this video, suggest an engaging activity
that will pair with this skill, or help me write a lesson plan. Or again, I can ask it any
open-ended question that I want. However, there are also
other things you can do. You can come here to the very, very top where it says Assign, Lesson
Hook, Exit Ticket, Lesson Plan, and then there's even an
option for More Tools. And what we've done here
is we've already put front and center the tools
that we know teachers use the most when engaging
with specific exercises and skills lessons, right? So most of the time
teachers want to be able to create a lesson hook for
a lesson or an exit ticket or a lesson plan specific
to this standard and skill. So you can automatically
write from that specific skill or lesson, click on Lesson Hook, and it's going to already populate for you the information from that
particular skill or lesson that you were in. And you can go ahead and click
on Write some lesson hooks, and Khanmigo is going to go ahead and provide three different
ideas for you to use as a lesson hook for
understanding factor pairs. Now of course, you are the
teacher. This is an assistant. This is a resource for you. If there is something that
you don't like about this or it didn't really, you know, fit with what you were wanting, you are able to interact
with Khanmigo, right? So you can click here
to the little purple, it'll highlight that section,
and you can ask Khanmigo. You can say, ""Make changes to this."" And you can tell Khanmigo
what kind of changes you want it to make. Or you can say, ""No, I
don't like this at all. Go ahead and, you know,
give me a different idea, give me something else."" Or you can discuss this with Khanmigo, maybe you have questions about it, right? You can go ahead and
open up the discuss this and discuss it with Khanmigo. You can also make
changes directly on here. ""I want to add an extension to this."" So you can go ahead and make
changes. You can delete. This is for you to make it your own. Once you're happy with whatever
you have, you can print it. You have the option to
print any of the resources that you get from the Khanmigo tools. You can also export, you can
export to a Microsoft Word, you can export to a PDF. You can save it to Google Drive, and you can also save it
to Microsoft OneDrive. In addition to that, there's
like a cloud built in, it's called My Documents. And it will save anything
that you do on Khanmigo tools here as well for you to
access in the future. So there's multiple ways that you can save anything that you do with Khanmigo. Now going to go ahead and
show you this Lesson Plan tool live because this is
another very popular tool. Again, I'm opening it directly from a particular skill or lesson, so it's gonna already auto-populate that. But you will see here shortly
where you can put anything that you want on here and it
will give you a lesson plan. And I'll show you how to do
that here in a few minutes. Now with the Lesson Plan tool, I want you guys to think
of this as a buffet. When we go to a buffet,
there is absolutely no way that we can try and eat every single thing that's in the buffet because there's just so,
so, so many options, right? We typically go, we look
at what's available, and we select what we want and what is the most appetizing for us. Same thing with the
Lesson Plan tool, right? It's always going to give
you a very robust plan. You're going to have lots and
lots of things to choose from. Again, you are able to
interact with Khanmigo at any point with whatever you've selected that you wanna interact with it for. You're able to delete, you're able to add, you're able to print,
export, save to the cloud, all of those great things. You're always going to have the objective. It's going to give you activities
in the form of warmups, direct instruction. It's also going to give
you guided practice. It's going to give you
independent practice. It's going to give you exit ticket ideas. It's also going to give
you differentiation for, here, it gave me differentiation
for advanced learners, striving learners. Maybe I have a lot of
emergent bilingual students in my class. I can go ahead and, you
know, ask it to give me, ""Give me ideas to support English learners."" Whoops. And so Khanmigo will go ahead and, or actually, I didn't
highlight the whole thing, so I needed to highlight. Khanmigo is going to go ahead
and give me support for that. So what you want, there it is. There's the support for English learners. And the more information
you can give Khanmigo, the more refined and detailed it can be. And that's something that you will learn as you start using the tools. You also have here notable definitions, extension activities. It gives you links to ways
that you can extend learning for students, things that you can go ahead and directly assign to your students. And then it gives you a lesson summary. So that's an example of
the Lesson Plan tool. Now remember I said that
you could access Khanmigo two different ways,
directly from the content with the little Khanmigo
icon at the bottom right. But you can also come
here to the very top menu where it says Khanmigo and you
would click on Teacher tools. And it's going to default here to all the tools available. This can be a little bit overwhelming. So we're gonna go ahead and
chunk this out a little bit. I want us to look at these
categories up at the top. So we have tools in purple that are going to specifically support your planning. We have tools, color coded in green, that are going to specifically support when you're having to create things. Like for example, maybe you
wanna do a class newsletter. This is one of my favorite ones, especially because it will
translate the newsletter for you, definitely in Spanish and Portuguese, 'cause Khanmigo is trilingual
in Portuguese and Spanish. And let's just say he's
conversational in other languages, so you may be able to
get some translations in other languages. However, the Spanish and Portuguese are gonna be the ones that
are gonna have that accuracy to where you could send without errors. Here, you would, give
the name of your class, you know, you could just quickly paste or put something in about
what you did last week, what's coming up next week. I'm just gonna say, you
know, something very quickly. Obviously the more details you put, the better it is going to be. And then maybe I'm gonna put here, or I wanna do a field trip reminder. It'll write the newsletter. And again, you would be
able to translate from here. You would be able to
export, print directly, or save it to your preferred method. With the Create tools, you also have things like
letters of recommendations if we have any high school
teachers on the webinar. I know that that's something
that can be quite popular in the spring with some of your, or fall in the spring with
some of your students. You can generate multiple choice quizzes, English teachers, science teachers, any project-based
learning, rubric generator. This rubric generator will go ahead and create a rubric for you
based on what you give it. You're also able to, especially, again, supporting your emergent
bilingual students or maybe students that have an IEP in certain accommodations. Clear Directions is another great tool to help support that. Here, with these red tools,
you have the differentiation. You can chunk text. Leveler will adjust the
complexity of any given text. We've tried it out, I've
tried it out with, you know, things as complex as the
Declaration of Independence to, you know, short stories, poems, et cetera. So Leveler is another one. Make it Relevant, here's
one that I have put as a favorite of mine because, you know, we're always trying to connect
and build relationships with our students in our classrooms. So here you can go ahead and, you know, put in your standard or your objective or whatever it is that
you're going to be teaching. And then, you know, using
maybe like a class intro survey or what you already know about your class, you can say, you know, let's see, maybe that your class is
really into the Dallas Cowboys. I don't know, I mean, I
feel like the Dallas Cowboys have lost popularity lately. And then it will go
ahead and connect, right, that skill or that concept
of linear equations with the Dallas Cowboys
so that you're able to, you know, hook and engage
your students accordingly. All right, let's see. Support, these blue tools help
support this IEP Assistant. Here's another example of the way that, you know, you could
again, leverage Khanmigo to help support your ARD meetings or help support you in
preparation for ARD meetings. Again, this is not meant to replace you or replace what you are
writing, but simply to help. Because remember, you know,
Khanmigo may have access to research and ideas that maybe we as an ARD committee do not. So it will never ask for any kind of identifying information on a student. But basically by providing
information on these prompts, you would be able to get recommendations and suggestions for Khanmigo
that may be something you may find helpful to incorporate into a student's 504 plan or IEP. SMART Goal Writer, this
I would highly recommend as you're creating your T-test goals. This could help support
you in writing those. And here with Learn you
have Refresh My Knowledge. And with Refresh My
Knowledge, if maybe you're new to the grade level, new
to the content area, new to teaching, Khanmigo
can kind of help you refresh, you know, the knowledge for maybe teaching that linear equations lesson. So this is Khanmigo. I'm gonna go ahead and pause
in case there are any questions that have come in or
anybody has any questions that they'd like to drop in the chat before we go back to our slides. - [Jennifer] We're all
good, Francis. Thank you. - Thank you. All right. So now we would like to wrap up with some ideas for implementation. So here you have sort of a matrix on good, better, and best ways
to implement Khan Academy. As a reminder, you know, those
two skills too proficient per week is what we really want, you know, to aim for for students. You know, some schools
may encourage students to go through the course on their own, and you know, like at home as homework, during maybe advisory or WIN. Others and other teachers
may decide to incorporate and integrate Khan and have
it, you know, in the classroom and have it be a part
of like structured time that's given to students. You know, we have found that
the most effective approach includes completing the course challenges because that's going to
kind of give you a baseline and the student a
baseline of where they are for that course. Again, that's recommended
three times per year, beginning, middle, end. Setting those mastery goal, again, you can set it at the course level, right? Assign the course because
you want the students to work through the content of that course throughout the school year. Or you can decide to set, in addition to a course mastery goal, you also could set unit goals, right, that align to your scope and sequence. You wanna always, you
know, encourage students to track their progress
and for them to understand, you know, what they're working towards. In our dashboard, actually, I'm gonna go ahead and
quickly just go back because I wanna share with you that you do have access to, you do have access to printable resources that you can use to
leverage the implementation. So here under, whoops, excuse me, in your main dashboard, in your main teacher
dashboard, you are able to, I think I just froze my... Trying to switch over. You have access to resources, and right here under Resources. This is where you would
access the documents for Khanmigo that we
talked about, that cloud. You also have access to all
of these printable resources and they're organized by topic for you. And then if you are wanting to learn more about how to get started for Khan, you also have this Getting
started with Khan for Educators that will show you how to add
courses, how to add goals, how to, you know, look at
your reports and the data. And you also have this
Khanmigo for Educators where you can get certified. You'll get a certificate
at the end of that course so that you are able to
leverage that as well. All right, so I'm gonna go ahead and switch back to the slide. And I know that we've been monitoring the chat for questions. If there's no questions at this time, I'm gonna go ahead and leave you all with our social media and
our help center information. We have lots and lots of blog articles that you can type in a question and it should take you to how-tos and directions on how to do things, in addition to those self-paced
courses that I showed you, you could also access on the platform. We'd love to have you also join our Khan Academy Facebook group. So that link is available
for you there as well. And the last link is a blog article that has
videos specific to Khanmigo and Khanmigo teacher tools
that you're able to access. They're very brief, short and engaging and will help you use Khanmigo. All right, that is our presentation. We hope that this was
helpful for all of you. And we look forward to
continuing our partnership and continuing to be
able to provide educators and teachers with resources
that can hopefully help both students and teachers. Thank you so much. I hope you have a wonderful
rest of your evening. Take care. Bye-bye.",Khan Academy Platform,"Introduces Khan Academy, an online platform that provides free, personalized learning experiences for students in grades two and up, with a focus on mastery learning.",00:00:00 - 00:03:00,2024-09-26T20:47:55Z,4790,76,4
How to Use Khan Academy's Free Courses for Texas Teachers and Students,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SxJXClDJcw,"- To share valuable free
resources with you today that I believe will not
only benefit your students, but also lighten your load as you manage the many, many decisions and tasks that come along with teaching nowadays. I really truly appreciate
everything that you do, and I hope that these
tools that we discuss today and these resources will
help simplify your workflow and give you more time to focus on what really matters most, right? All right. So for today, we'll be exploring the Khan Academy platform together. We're gonna start with
the teacher dashboard and the newly added TEKS-aligned courses, which also come with a downloadable, printable teachers guide. And we're also going to
introduce you to Khanmigo, your AI-powered teaching assistant. And before we wrap up, we'll also go over some practical ways that
you can start integrating Khan Academy into your
classroom right away to complement your existing instruction and all of the great things
that are already going on. So we also have joining us
today from Khan Academy, Jennifer Nav-iv, who will be supporting by answering your questions in the chat. So please feel free to ask away. And as a reminder, we are
recording this webinar. We will be sending it out
to anyone who registers so that you can revisit this
information anytime you need. And at the end, we'll also
include the information of our help center where
you can also get answers to your questions. So before we get started,
I'd like to introduce your dedicated Khan Academy Texas team. We are all based right here in Texas and are committed to supporting
districts and schools throughout our Khan
Academy Districts program. Now, while districts do have
the option to partner with us for additional benefits
like automatic rostering, professional development,
data and reporting, as well as ongoing implementation support, today we'll be focusing
exclusively on the free resources that are always available
to all educators. Oh, you know what? Went a slide too far back. So if could just quickly
check in with everyone. And if you could please
drop a one, two, or three in the chat to let us know how familiar you are with Khan Academy, where one means that
you're just starting out, you haven't really ever
been on the platform, don't really know much about it. Two means that you have some experience, and three means that you're
very familiar with our platform. So if you could just take a minute to please go ahead and
drop that in the chat. And while you're doing
that, I'm going to go ahead and talk to you a little bit
about what is Khan Academy. And we are a nonprofit organization. Our mission is to provide free world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We do this through our online platform. We offer personalized learning
experiences for students, grades second and up is the platform that we're gonna be exploring today. We also have Khan Kids available as an app for our little ones. And we do focus on mastery learning, allowing students to
progress at their own pace and ensuring that they fully
understand each concept before moving on, because our
goal is to empower learners and help them reach that grade
level mastery and beyond. So I'd like to, before we
go live into the platform, take a moment to explore this
concept of mastery learning, which is at the
cornerstone of Khan Academy and how Khan Academy is structured. As I said, we embrace mastery
learning, this approach, because it ensures that
students fully understand a skill or concept before
they move on to the next one. And this method not only fosters a deep understanding, but it also is supported
by robust evidence showing its effectiveness and improving the long-term retention
of skills and knowledge. And it does this by providing
thorough understanding in combination with timely feedback and pacing that is
appropriate for the learner and where that learner is at, while embedding those strategic
scaffolds along the way. And especially here in Texas, you know, this type of
approach is essential for success on assessments
like STAAR, TSIA2, and of course the SAT for
our high schoolers as well. So to illustrate this further,
let's take a look at this brief video that explains
mastery learning in more detail. - [Announcer] Have you ever
really tried to learn something and you just couldn't? It can make you feel like
you're not so smart, right? Well, it's not your fault and it's not your teacher's fault, it's just our traditional
approach to learning. We go through school
and we accumulate gaps. You're a bit shaky on pre-algebra, but you move on to algebra anyway. By the time you get to calculus,
you've got lots of gaps. If enough gaps build up,
you'll eventually hit a wall. Calculus makes no sense. And that can be frustrating. But what if there were a
different way to learn? That's mastery learning. Unlike traditional
learning where all students move in lockstep, with mastery learning, you go at your own pace. You progress through questions at just the right level for you. If you get 50% right the first
time, it's not a big deal. Try as many times as you need. Get feedback as you learn
and help you need it. Features can track your progress, identify any gaps and give
you one-on-one attention. Decades of research shows
mastery learning works. Now you have the tools
to make it possible. Are you ready to learn anything? - All right. So now we're gonna go
ahead and switch over so that we can do some
of the fun exploring right on the platform. All right, let's... Let's go ahead and switch
over to the platform. And there we are. All right, so we're
gonna go ahead and start. Once you log in, you create your account. You'll see this teacher dashboard. Depending on whether or
not you've added classes, you may or may not see this class section. But we're gonna go through
how you can add courses. The first thing you wanna
do is you wanna come here to the Explore section. The Explore section is going
to give you this dropdown that has the list of all
of our course offerings that are available to
you and to your students. As you can see, we offer
a wide range of courses. Couple things that I wanna note here. The SAT, the digital
SAT test prep courses, these have been widely
utilized across the US for many years because we
are the official partners with College Board. So with the digital SAT, they or your selves could come. Here we have the digital SAT Math. We also have the digital
SAT Reading and Writing as two separate recourse. The domains are broken into foundations, and then the questions get
harder with the medium level and then all the way into advanced. So that is one that I wanted
to make sure to point out because it is very popular here in Texas with our teachers and our students. All of the courses are designed to complement your
grade level instruction. So they offer activities
that encourage students to think deeply. They can access various
instructional materials within the courses to help
scaffold that learning and help support them as
they go through the practices and the exercises. These include videos, the
famous videos by Sal Khan that I'm sure a lot of you
have already heard in the past. It also includes articles, and there are also opportunities to check for understanding through
quizzes, unit tests. We also have course
challenges that can be done three times a year if you'd
like, as a beginning of year, middle of year, end of year checkpoint. And those course challenges
are going to give, they're 30 questions,
about 30 to 45 minutes, and they're gonna give students
a sprinkling of questions for the whole course, right? So again, there's definitely various ways that students can check for understanding and you as teachers can
have data and reports on how your students are doing. Additionally, our content is
also available in 24 languages, which this is, I think, an incredible feature and resource, especially for our emergent
bilingual students, right? So if you have emergent bilingual students that maybe you would like
them to see the content in their native language to help support what you're doing in the classroom as they transition to English,
this is another option that you can do as well, assign to those students and have them go through the content in
their native language. So in addition to browsing
by course, as you see here, you can also, for math only,
you can browse by standards. So if you come up here
to Browse By Standards, and select Texas, you now see that we have
alignment from grades second through eighth,
Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, Precalc, Mathematical
Models with Applications, Advanced Quantitative
Reasoning, Discrete Mathematics for Problem Solving,
and Algebraic Reasoning. I'm just gonna go ahead
and select the Algebra I to give you an example
of what this looks like. So here you will see by standard, the standard is written out, and then you have a list of all
the resources and activities that can be assigned to students to help support that standard. So if you know this is
something that you're going to be teaching and you want
to maybe use one of our videos as an opening to your lesson
and show it whole group, or maybe you want to, you
know, strategically assign it to your students for them to complete it during independent class time or homework, this is another way that
you can access the content so that it aligns to
your scope and sequence and to what's happening in your classroom. Here on the left-hand side, you can see all of the courses that this is available for. You can always open up the dropdown so that you're able to see
the standards that are aligned and the activities that go along with it. All right, so now I'm gonna go ahead and shift over to our
new Texas TEKS courses. We're gonna go ahead and take a little bit of a deeper dive into those. And thanks to the Open Doors project and a generous donation that was provided by the ExxonMobil Foundation,
our content team has created courses just for Texas
that align to the TEKS for math in grades five through eight, also Algebra I, as well
as high school biology, high school chemistry
and high school physics. And with the continued
support of ExxonMobil, we do have plans next year
to expand these Texas courses to include third and fourth grade math as well as Algebra II, Geometry, Precalc, middle school chemistry, and integrated sciences
sixth through seventh grade. And then there are plans
to add even more courses for '26, '27. So definitely, you know,
be on the lookout for those as those get added to our platform. So now I'm gonna go ahead and just select one of these courses. I'm gonna go ahead and go
into 5th grade Texas TEKS because there are a number
of additional resources that you're going to find exclusively in these Texas TEKS courses that was done as part of the work that the ExxonMobil grant was
able to provide Khan Academy. So when you open the
courses, all of our courses, does not matter what grade
level or what subject, they're all going to
visually look the same, and they're all gonna structurally
look and feel the same. The flow is gonna be the same. We're gonna have the units for that course on the left-hand side. You as the teacher, are able
to go to each of these unit and, again, assign at the course level, at the unit level or by
individual activities, as you saw earlier with the
videos and the articles. Now here you have these
white boxes, right? And the white boxes represent skills. A white box is a skill that has
not been started yet, right? A student has not interacted
with any type of content for that particular skill. And once the student clicks
on the box or the skill and starts their practice, it's going to take them through exercises that have embedded many
times the specific video or article that will
help support them, right? So if they're in the
problem and they just, you know, they're kind of
struggling, they don't remember, instead of them having to
go, you know, back through the list of units or exercises available, the platform has already, you
know, linked for them here a related content, video or article that they can quickly access. It will open in a new
window so that the student can get that just in
time support they need as they're working
through these exercises. Once students complete
exercises and/or quizzes or unit tests, these
boxes are going to get one of these four colors. They're either going to
get a, like, burnt orange, a lighter orange, a lavender purple, or a dark purple with a crown. So when they get this burnt
orange color box, right, it means that when the
students engaged in problems or quizzes, tests, et cetera,
with that particular skill, they got less than 70% of
those questions correctly. In a familiar, in a light orange, they got 70% or more
correct within that skill. If you see the lavender, the proficient, then that means that they got
100% of the questions correct when practicing that skill. Now you might say to
yourself, ""Wait a minute, but if that's 100%, then what
could possibly be Mastered?"" So Mastered is when they see that skill, they're assessed on that skill in context with other skills, right? So it's a mixed skill assessment, and they still get 100% of the questions for that skill correct? So in Proficient, they're at 100%, but that skill is being
assessed in isolation. With Mastery, they get
100% of that skill correct, but they're seeing that skill
mixed in with other skills. So it's a little bit more difficult because it's now out of context. So what we want to see and
what we want to aim for, right, what our research shows is that students that can reach these purples, at least two purples per week, so two skills to proficiency per week, are going to be on track to accelerate their learning by at least 35%. And in many cases we see, you know, even bigger gains than that. So as you're thinking about, you know, those student data chats
and assigning goals and really trying to engage your students in purposeful learning, what
you really wanna aim for are for students to level
up to these purples, skills to proficient,
at least two per week. And a common question that we
sometimes get from educators is, ""Well, how long do the students need to be on the platform?"" So with Khan Academy, again, you know, mastery learning is our cornerstone. It's not about time, it's
really about the learning that's happening. And so it's difficult to say, you know, give you an exact amount of time. However, what our research has shown is that it typically
takes students anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per
week to reach that minimum of two skills to proficiency. So, you know, you wanna
think about, again, everybody learns at a different
pace and there may be skills that, you know, they're much
more adept in than others. So a good timeframe to have in your mind is providing opportunities
for 30 to 60 minutes per week. And again, that can look a
variety of different ways. It can be assigned as
independent classwork, it can be assigned as homework, but definitely giving
students an an opportunity to engage weekly on the platform. All right, before I move on, are there any questions in
the chat, Jennifer Aviv, that we should address whole group? - [Jennifer] No, we're good at this time. Thank you, Francis.
- Awesome, excellent. Okay, so with that, I wanna go ahead and dive into these special teacher resources that are part of the Texas TEKS courses. You can access them right
here from the home dashboard under Check out our teacher resources. You can also access them at the very end of the left-hand nav menu
here under Teacher resources. And once you select that,
it's going to take you to this landing page,
which is going to give you a guide on how to use the
teacher guides, right? But it's also going to give you access to these downloadable and printable guides that are organized by unit, right? So I'm gonna go ahead and open up Unit 1, Extending whole number operations. It gives you the standards that this guide is going to cover. Once you click on that PDF, it is going to provide you
with objectives, strategies. It's gonna give you common misconceptions. It's gonna link you out to
any that are referenced. Once we scroll down into the
actual unit resources, right, and again, these are all
going to align to the content that's on Khan, so it's
going to tell you here not only the objective
and the teaching tips to help you as your lesson
planning and as you're delivering this instruction in your whole group, but it's also going to
tell you how many videos are available, how many
articles, and how many exercises to support that particular
lesson and standard. And you're also going to have
a Best practices section. It's going to walk you through
with very specific examples as well as like verbiage on
how to think through this, teach this, support
this in your classroom, and give you also links to additional general implementation resources
that you can use to support these standards and this
unit and these lessons in your classroom. So I'm going to go ahead and go back here. I'm gonna go ahead and
just select this unit just so that, again, you can kind of see how it's structured. So now instead of seeing all
the boxes for all the skills and the entire course,
which are 161 skills, you see that information here
underneath Grade 5 Texas TEKS, again, all the courses will have that, now I'm only seeing for that specific unit how many skills are available. So here students would work through these three and then have a quiz after those exercises,
right, for that skill. Then they're gonna work
through this skill. There's two exercises and
then they'll take a quiz. And that is how it's repeated, right? These little lightning
icons represent quizzes after each skill. And at the very end of the unit, they're gonna take the unit test, which is going to give them questions from each of the skills
that they worked through in the unit. Again, the really great
thing about Khan is that you, as the teacher, have the
flexibility to assign course mastery goals. So if you want to, you know,
make sure that the students have a goal to get
through the whole course by the end of the year, you can do that. You can assign by unit if you wanna chunk the material for
them and have it aligned to your scope and sequence. Because maybe unit one for
you is going to be something that you're teaching in January. So that's okay, you can assign
these units out of order, however they best fit with
your scope and sequence and what you're doing in the
classroom to help support you. You're always gonna have
access to the Assign button. From there, you're gonna be able to assign at the class level. So if you wanna assign it to all students, or if you wanna assign it to
a select group of students, you're also able to do that. And you're able to, with anything, also give specific due dates. And that's what would
create that assignment so that the students
then see that information on their dashboards when
they log in as students. All right. Let's see. From here, I'm gonna go ahead and go back. One thing that here, like I said, you can assign the course. Again, you would be able
to select your class and your students. There's a way that you can
provide a link to students so that students can link their accounts to your class. And with that, some of
the additional benefits of adding that information
is that you will get data, and you will get information
on how your students are doing based on things that you
have assigned to your class and to your students. All right, so we're gonna go ahead now and shift over to Khanmigo. Very, very excited to share
with you all things Khanmigo, because this is the new
AI-powered teaching assistant that has been integrated into Khan Academy to help support you as teachers in not only instructional pieces, but also administrative
tasks that we know teachers are asked to do as part of
their everyday workload. So we're gonna look at different ways that you can leverage
Khanmigo to help you. So there's a couple of ways
that you can access Khanmigo. I'm going to show you first one way, and then we will look at the second way that you can do that. The first way is Khanmigo is
always going to be hovering here on the lower right-hand corner anywhere you are in the platform, right? So if you wake Khanmigo
up and initiate Khanmigo from one of our courses or
from somewhere in the platform, it is going to automatically
know where you are, right? So the prompts that it's going to give you are going to be specific to wherever you are on the platform. So I'm going to say that
I'm in Algebraic reasoning. I know that this is coming up. I'm trying to kind of
think through what to do. I can open Khanmigo and I can go ahead and ask it questions directly, or I can use one of
these automated prompts, and Khanmigo will go ahead
and give me information based on what I ask it. One thing that I wanna point
out, a couple of things, here you're going to see this battery. Right now, it says that I'm at 95%. I've been using it quite a bit today. Khanmigo does run on
something called AI tokens. And so there it is sort
of like a battery, right? There's a 24-hour limit. We've never seen the battery run out, at least not up to this point. And we work with Khanmigo every day. But just in case, we wanna just make sure that you guys are aware of that. And it's like Cinderella. It resets nightly. So no worries. If you're ever low, it's okay. The next day you're back to 100%. The other thing that I
want to point out for you are these Leave feedback buttons. You can either leave as a
thumbs up or a thumbs down, and that'll be the end of that. Or you can click on where
it says Leave feedback, and you can be a little bit more detailed with the type of feedback
that you provide. This, there's actually
somebody on our team that this is her job, is
to analyze this feedback. So this does not go somewhere
in a cloud or to a robot or something that nobody ever sees. Like, this feedback actually
goes to a human person, you know, at the Khan Academy team whose job is to make sure
that we are making, you know, improvements and that
we're constantly ensuring that Khanmigo is doing
what it needs to do. So please, you know, don't
ever hesitate to reach out to us via the Leave feedback. Now I wanna go ahead and go
into an actual lesson, right? So here I'm in Understanding factor pairs, again, I can open up Khanmigo. As you can see now that
I'm in a specific skill, Khanmigo's prompts have changed. Now Khanmigo is giving me the option to summarize this video,
help me explain this video, suggest an engaging activity
that will pair with this skill, or help me write a lesson plan. Or again, I can ask it any
open-ended question that I want. However, there are also
other things you can do. You can come here to the very, very top where it says Assign, Lesson
Hook, Exit Ticket, Lesson Plan, and then there's even an
option for More Tools. And what we've done here
is we've already put front and center the tools
that we know teachers use the most when engaging
with specific exercises and skills lessons, right? So most of the time
teachers want to be able to create a lesson hook for
a lesson or an exit ticket or a lesson plan specific
to this standard and skill. So you can automatically
write from that specific skill or lesson, click on Lesson Hook, and it's going to already populate for you the information from that
particular skill or lesson that you were in. And you can go ahead and click
on Write some lesson hooks, and Khanmigo is going to go ahead and provide three different
ideas for you to use as a lesson hook for
understanding factor pairs. Now of course, you are the
teacher. This is an assistant. This is a resource for you. If there is something that
you don't like about this or it didn't really, you know, fit with what you were wanting, you are able to interact
with Khanmigo, right? So you can click here
to the little purple, it'll highlight that section,
and you can ask Khanmigo. You can say, ""Make changes to this."" And you can tell Khanmigo
what kind of changes you want it to make. Or you can say, ""No, I
don't like this at all. Go ahead and, you know,
give me a different idea, give me something else."" Or you can discuss this with Khanmigo, maybe you have questions about it, right? You can go ahead and
open up the discuss this and discuss it with Khanmigo. You can also make
changes directly on here. ""I want to add an extension to this."" So you can go ahead and make
changes. You can delete. This is for you to make it your own. Once you're happy with whatever
you have, you can print it. You have the option to
print any of the resources that you get from the Khanmigo tools. You can also export, you can
export to a Microsoft Word, you can export to a PDF. You can save it to Google Drive, and you can also save it
to Microsoft OneDrive. In addition to that, there's
like a cloud built in, it's called My Documents. And it will save anything
that you do on Khanmigo tools here as well for you to
access in the future. So there's multiple ways that you can save anything that you do with Khanmigo. Now going to go ahead and
show you this Lesson Plan tool live because this is
another very popular tool. Again, I'm opening it directly from a particular skill or lesson, so it's gonna already auto-populate that. But you will see here shortly
where you can put anything that you want on here and it
will give you a lesson plan. And I'll show you how to do
that here in a few minutes. Now with the Lesson Plan tool, I want you guys to think
of this as a buffet. When we go to a buffet,
there is absolutely no way that we can try and eat every single thing that's in the buffet because there's just so,
so, so many options, right? We typically go, we look
at what's available, and we select what we want and what is the most appetizing for us. Same thing with the
Lesson Plan tool, right? It's always going to give
you a very robust plan. You're going to have lots and
lots of things to choose from. Again, you are able to
interact with Khanmigo at any point with whatever you've selected that you wanna interact with it for. You're able to delete, you're able to add, you're able to print,
export, save to the cloud, all of those great things. You're always going to have the objective. It's going to give you activities
in the form of warmups, direct instruction. It's also going to give
you guided practice. It's going to give you
independent practice. It's going to give you exit ticket ideas. It's also going to give
you differentiation for, here, it gave me differentiation
for advanced learners, striving learners. Maybe I have a lot of
emergent bilingual students in my class. I can go ahead and, you
know, ask it to give me, ""Give me ideas to support English learners."" Whoops. And so Khanmigo will go ahead and, or actually, I didn't
highlight the whole thing, so I needed to highlight. Khanmigo is going to go ahead
and give me support for that. So what you want, there it is. There's the support for English learners. And the more information
you can give Khanmigo, the more refined and detailed it can be. And that's something that you will learn as you start using the tools. You also have here notable definitions, extension activities. It gives you links to ways
that you can extend learning for students, things that you can go ahead and directly assign to your students. And then it gives you a lesson summary. So that's an example of
the Lesson Plan tool. Now remember I said that
you could access Khanmigo two different ways,
directly from the content with the little Khanmigo
icon at the bottom right. But you can also come
here to the very top menu where it says Khanmigo and you
would click on Teacher tools. And it's going to default here to all the tools available. This can be a little bit overwhelming. So we're gonna go ahead and
chunk this out a little bit. I want us to look at these
categories up at the top. So we have tools in purple that are going to specifically support your planning. We have tools, color coded in green, that are going to specifically support when you're having to create things. Like for example, maybe you
wanna do a class newsletter. This is one of my favorite ones, especially because it will
translate the newsletter for you, definitely in Spanish and Portuguese, 'cause Khanmigo is trilingual
in Portuguese and Spanish. And let's just say he's
conversational in other languages, so you may be able to
get some translations in other languages. However, the Spanish and Portuguese are gonna be the ones that
are gonna have that accuracy to where you could send without errors. Here, you would, give
the name of your class, you know, you could just quickly paste or put something in about
what you did last week, what's coming up next week. I'm just gonna say, you
know, something very quickly. Obviously the more details you put, the better it is going to be. And then maybe I'm gonna put here, or I wanna do a field trip reminder. It'll write the newsletter. And again, you would be
able to translate from here. You would be able to
export, print directly, or save it to your preferred method. With the Create tools, you also have things like
letters of recommendations if we have any high school
teachers on the webinar. I know that that's something
that can be quite popular in the spring with some of your, or fall in the spring with
some of your students. You can generate multiple choice quizzes, English teachers, science teachers, any project-based
learning, rubric generator. This rubric generator will go ahead and create a rubric for you
based on what you give it. You're also able to, especially, again, supporting your emergent
bilingual students or maybe students that have an IEP in certain accommodations. Clear Directions is another great tool to help support that. Here, with these red tools,
you have the differentiation. You can chunk text. Leveler will adjust the
complexity of any given text. We've tried it out, I've
tried it out with, you know, things as complex as the
Declaration of Independence to, you know, short stories, poems, et cetera. So Leveler is another one. Make it Relevant, here's
one that I have put as a favorite of mine because, you know, we're always trying to connect
and build relationships with our students in our classrooms. So here you can go ahead and, you know, put in your standard or your objective or whatever it is that
you're going to be teaching. And then, you know, using
maybe like a class intro survey or what you already know about your class, you can say, you know, let's see, maybe that your class is
really into the Dallas Cowboys. I don't know, I mean, I
feel like the Dallas Cowboys have lost popularity lately. And then it will go
ahead and connect, right, that skill or that concept
of linear equations with the Dallas Cowboys
so that you're able to, you know, hook and engage
your students accordingly. All right, let's see. Support, these blue tools help
support this IEP Assistant. Here's another example of the way that, you know, you could
again, leverage Khanmigo to help support your ARD meetings or help support you in
preparation for ARD meetings. Again, this is not meant to replace you or replace what you are
writing, but simply to help. Because remember, you know,
Khanmigo may have access to research and ideas that maybe we as an ARD committee do not. So it will never ask for any kind of identifying information on a student. But basically by providing
information on these prompts, you would be able to get recommendations and suggestions for Khanmigo
that may be something you may find helpful to incorporate into a student's 504 plan or IEP. SMART Goal Writer, this
I would highly recommend as you're creating your T-test goals. This could help support
you in writing those. And here with Learn you
have Refresh My Knowledge. And with Refresh My
Knowledge, if maybe you're new to the grade level, new
to the content area, new to teaching, Khanmigo
can kind of help you refresh, you know, the knowledge for maybe teaching that linear equations lesson. So this is Khanmigo. I'm gonna go ahead and pause
in case there are any questions that have come in or
anybody has any questions that they'd like to drop in the chat before we go back to our slides. - [Jennifer] We're all
good, Francis. Thank you. - Thank you. All right. So now we would like to wrap up with some ideas for implementation. So here you have sort of a matrix on good, better, and best ways
to implement Khan Academy. As a reminder, you know, those
two skills too proficient per week is what we really want, you know, to aim for for students. You know, some schools
may encourage students to go through the course on their own, and you know, like at home as homework, during maybe advisory or WIN. Others and other teachers
may decide to incorporate and integrate Khan and have
it, you know, in the classroom and have it be a part
of like structured time that's given to students. You know, we have found that
the most effective approach includes completing the course challenges because that's going to
kind of give you a baseline and the student a
baseline of where they are for that course. Again, that's recommended
three times per year, beginning, middle, end. Setting those mastery goal, again, you can set it at the course level, right? Assign the course because
you want the students to work through the content of that course throughout the school year. Or you can decide to set, in addition to a course mastery goal, you also could set unit goals, right, that align to your scope and sequence. You wanna always, you
know, encourage students to track their progress
and for them to understand, you know, what they're working towards. In our dashboard, actually, I'm gonna go ahead and
quickly just go back because I wanna share with you that you do have access to, you do have access to printable resources that you can use to
leverage the implementation. So here under, whoops, excuse me, in your main dashboard, in your main teacher
dashboard, you are able to, I think I just froze my... Trying to switch over. You have access to resources, and right here under Resources. This is where you would
access the documents for Khanmigo that we
talked about, that cloud. You also have access to all
of these printable resources and they're organized by topic for you. And then if you are wanting to learn more about how to get started for Khan, you also have this Getting
started with Khan for Educators that will show you how to add
courses, how to add goals, how to, you know, look at
your reports and the data. And you also have this
Khanmigo for Educators where you can get certified. You'll get a certificate
at the end of that course so that you are able to
leverage that as well. All right, so I'm gonna go ahead and switch back to the slide. And I know that we've been monitoring the chat for questions. If there's no questions at this time, I'm gonna go ahead and leave you all with our social media and
our help center information. We have lots and lots of blog articles that you can type in a question and it should take you to how-tos and directions on how to do things, in addition to those self-paced
courses that I showed you, you could also access on the platform. We'd love to have you also join our Khan Academy Facebook group. So that link is available
for you there as well. And the last link is a blog article that has
videos specific to Khanmigo and Khanmigo teacher tools
that you're able to access. They're very brief, short and engaging and will help you use Khanmigo. All right, that is our presentation. We hope that this was
helpful for all of you. And we look forward to
continuing our partnership and continuing to be
able to provide educators and teachers with resources
that can hopefully help both students and teachers. Thank you so much. I hope you have a wonderful
rest of your evening. Take care. Bye-bye.",Free Resources for Teachers,"Highlights the free resources offered by Khan Academy, including the teacher dashboard, TEKS-aligned courses, downloadable teacher guides, and AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo.",00:03:00 - 00:04:30,2024-09-26T20:47:55Z,4790,76,4
How to Use Khan Academy's Free Courses for Texas Teachers and Students,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SxJXClDJcw,"- To share valuable free
resources with you today that I believe will not
only benefit your students, but also lighten your load as you manage the many, many decisions and tasks that come along with teaching nowadays. I really truly appreciate
everything that you do, and I hope that these
tools that we discuss today and these resources will
help simplify your workflow and give you more time to focus on what really matters most, right? All right. So for today, we'll be exploring the Khan Academy platform together. We're gonna start with
the teacher dashboard and the newly added TEKS-aligned courses, which also come with a downloadable, printable teachers guide. And we're also going to
introduce you to Khanmigo, your AI-powered teaching assistant. And before we wrap up, we'll also go over some practical ways that
you can start integrating Khan Academy into your
classroom right away to complement your existing instruction and all of the great things
that are already going on. So we also have joining us
today from Khan Academy, Jennifer Nav-iv, who will be supporting by answering your questions in the chat. So please feel free to ask away. And as a reminder, we are
recording this webinar. We will be sending it out
to anyone who registers so that you can revisit this
information anytime you need. And at the end, we'll also
include the information of our help center where
you can also get answers to your questions. So before we get started,
I'd like to introduce your dedicated Khan Academy Texas team. We are all based right here in Texas and are committed to supporting
districts and schools throughout our Khan
Academy Districts program. Now, while districts do have
the option to partner with us for additional benefits
like automatic rostering, professional development,
data and reporting, as well as ongoing implementation support, today we'll be focusing
exclusively on the free resources that are always available
to all educators. Oh, you know what? Went a slide too far back. So if could just quickly
check in with everyone. And if you could please
drop a one, two, or three in the chat to let us know how familiar you are with Khan Academy, where one means that
you're just starting out, you haven't really ever
been on the platform, don't really know much about it. Two means that you have some experience, and three means that you're
very familiar with our platform. So if you could just take a minute to please go ahead and
drop that in the chat. And while you're doing
that, I'm going to go ahead and talk to you a little bit
about what is Khan Academy. And we are a nonprofit organization. Our mission is to provide free world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We do this through our online platform. We offer personalized learning
experiences for students, grades second and up is the platform that we're gonna be exploring today. We also have Khan Kids available as an app for our little ones. And we do focus on mastery learning, allowing students to
progress at their own pace and ensuring that they fully
understand each concept before moving on, because our
goal is to empower learners and help them reach that grade
level mastery and beyond. So I'd like to, before we
go live into the platform, take a moment to explore this
concept of mastery learning, which is at the
cornerstone of Khan Academy and how Khan Academy is structured. As I said, we embrace mastery
learning, this approach, because it ensures that
students fully understand a skill or concept before
they move on to the next one. And this method not only fosters a deep understanding, but it also is supported
by robust evidence showing its effectiveness and improving the long-term retention
of skills and knowledge. And it does this by providing
thorough understanding in combination with timely feedback and pacing that is
appropriate for the learner and where that learner is at, while embedding those strategic
scaffolds along the way. And especially here in Texas, you know, this type of
approach is essential for success on assessments
like STAAR, TSIA2, and of course the SAT for
our high schoolers as well. So to illustrate this further,
let's take a look at this brief video that explains
mastery learning in more detail. - [Announcer] Have you ever
really tried to learn something and you just couldn't? It can make you feel like
you're not so smart, right? Well, it's not your fault and it's not your teacher's fault, it's just our traditional
approach to learning. We go through school
and we accumulate gaps. You're a bit shaky on pre-algebra, but you move on to algebra anyway. By the time you get to calculus,
you've got lots of gaps. If enough gaps build up,
you'll eventually hit a wall. Calculus makes no sense. And that can be frustrating. But what if there were a
different way to learn? That's mastery learning. Unlike traditional
learning where all students move in lockstep, with mastery learning, you go at your own pace. You progress through questions at just the right level for you. If you get 50% right the first
time, it's not a big deal. Try as many times as you need. Get feedback as you learn
and help you need it. Features can track your progress, identify any gaps and give
you one-on-one attention. Decades of research shows
mastery learning works. Now you have the tools
to make it possible. Are you ready to learn anything? - All right. So now we're gonna go
ahead and switch over so that we can do some
of the fun exploring right on the platform. All right, let's... Let's go ahead and switch
over to the platform. And there we are. All right, so we're
gonna go ahead and start. Once you log in, you create your account. You'll see this teacher dashboard. Depending on whether or
not you've added classes, you may or may not see this class section. But we're gonna go through
how you can add courses. The first thing you wanna
do is you wanna come here to the Explore section. The Explore section is going
to give you this dropdown that has the list of all
of our course offerings that are available to
you and to your students. As you can see, we offer
a wide range of courses. Couple things that I wanna note here. The SAT, the digital
SAT test prep courses, these have been widely
utilized across the US for many years because we
are the official partners with College Board. So with the digital SAT, they or your selves could come. Here we have the digital SAT Math. We also have the digital
SAT Reading and Writing as two separate recourse. The domains are broken into foundations, and then the questions get
harder with the medium level and then all the way into advanced. So that is one that I wanted
to make sure to point out because it is very popular here in Texas with our teachers and our students. All of the courses are designed to complement your
grade level instruction. So they offer activities
that encourage students to think deeply. They can access various
instructional materials within the courses to help
scaffold that learning and help support them as
they go through the practices and the exercises. These include videos, the
famous videos by Sal Khan that I'm sure a lot of you
have already heard in the past. It also includes articles, and there are also opportunities to check for understanding through
quizzes, unit tests. We also have course
challenges that can be done three times a year if you'd
like, as a beginning of year, middle of year, end of year checkpoint. And those course challenges
are going to give, they're 30 questions,
about 30 to 45 minutes, and they're gonna give students
a sprinkling of questions for the whole course, right? So again, there's definitely various ways that students can check for understanding and you as teachers can
have data and reports on how your students are doing. Additionally, our content is
also available in 24 languages, which this is, I think, an incredible feature and resource, especially for our emergent
bilingual students, right? So if you have emergent bilingual students that maybe you would like
them to see the content in their native language to help support what you're doing in the classroom as they transition to English,
this is another option that you can do as well, assign to those students and have them go through the content in
their native language. So in addition to browsing
by course, as you see here, you can also, for math only,
you can browse by standards. So if you come up here
to Browse By Standards, and select Texas, you now see that we have
alignment from grades second through eighth,
Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, Precalc, Mathematical
Models with Applications, Advanced Quantitative
Reasoning, Discrete Mathematics for Problem Solving,
and Algebraic Reasoning. I'm just gonna go ahead
and select the Algebra I to give you an example
of what this looks like. So here you will see by standard, the standard is written out, and then you have a list of all
the resources and activities that can be assigned to students to help support that standard. So if you know this is
something that you're going to be teaching and you want
to maybe use one of our videos as an opening to your lesson
and show it whole group, or maybe you want to, you
know, strategically assign it to your students for them to complete it during independent class time or homework, this is another way that
you can access the content so that it aligns to
your scope and sequence and to what's happening in your classroom. Here on the left-hand side, you can see all of the courses that this is available for. You can always open up the dropdown so that you're able to see
the standards that are aligned and the activities that go along with it. All right, so now I'm gonna go ahead and shift over to our
new Texas TEKS courses. We're gonna go ahead and take a little bit of a deeper dive into those. And thanks to the Open Doors project and a generous donation that was provided by the ExxonMobil Foundation,
our content team has created courses just for Texas
that align to the TEKS for math in grades five through eight, also Algebra I, as well
as high school biology, high school chemistry
and high school physics. And with the continued
support of ExxonMobil, we do have plans next year
to expand these Texas courses to include third and fourth grade math as well as Algebra II, Geometry, Precalc, middle school chemistry, and integrated sciences
sixth through seventh grade. And then there are plans
to add even more courses for '26, '27. So definitely, you know,
be on the lookout for those as those get added to our platform. So now I'm gonna go ahead and just select one of these courses. I'm gonna go ahead and go
into 5th grade Texas TEKS because there are a number
of additional resources that you're going to find exclusively in these Texas TEKS courses that was done as part of the work that the ExxonMobil grant was
able to provide Khan Academy. So when you open the
courses, all of our courses, does not matter what grade
level or what subject, they're all going to
visually look the same, and they're all gonna structurally
look and feel the same. The flow is gonna be the same. We're gonna have the units for that course on the left-hand side. You as the teacher, are able
to go to each of these unit and, again, assign at the course level, at the unit level or by
individual activities, as you saw earlier with the
videos and the articles. Now here you have these
white boxes, right? And the white boxes represent skills. A white box is a skill that has
not been started yet, right? A student has not interacted
with any type of content for that particular skill. And once the student clicks
on the box or the skill and starts their practice, it's going to take them through exercises that have embedded many
times the specific video or article that will
help support them, right? So if they're in the
problem and they just, you know, they're kind of
struggling, they don't remember, instead of them having to
go, you know, back through the list of units or exercises available, the platform has already, you
know, linked for them here a related content, video or article that they can quickly access. It will open in a new
window so that the student can get that just in
time support they need as they're working
through these exercises. Once students complete
exercises and/or quizzes or unit tests, these
boxes are going to get one of these four colors. They're either going to
get a, like, burnt orange, a lighter orange, a lavender purple, or a dark purple with a crown. So when they get this burnt
orange color box, right, it means that when the
students engaged in problems or quizzes, tests, et cetera,
with that particular skill, they got less than 70% of
those questions correctly. In a familiar, in a light orange, they got 70% or more
correct within that skill. If you see the lavender, the proficient, then that means that they got
100% of the questions correct when practicing that skill. Now you might say to
yourself, ""Wait a minute, but if that's 100%, then what
could possibly be Mastered?"" So Mastered is when they see that skill, they're assessed on that skill in context with other skills, right? So it's a mixed skill assessment, and they still get 100% of the questions for that skill correct? So in Proficient, they're at 100%, but that skill is being
assessed in isolation. With Mastery, they get
100% of that skill correct, but they're seeing that skill
mixed in with other skills. So it's a little bit more difficult because it's now out of context. So what we want to see and
what we want to aim for, right, what our research shows is that students that can reach these purples, at least two purples per week, so two skills to proficiency per week, are going to be on track to accelerate their learning by at least 35%. And in many cases we see, you know, even bigger gains than that. So as you're thinking about, you know, those student data chats
and assigning goals and really trying to engage your students in purposeful learning, what
you really wanna aim for are for students to level
up to these purples, skills to proficient,
at least two per week. And a common question that we
sometimes get from educators is, ""Well, how long do the students need to be on the platform?"" So with Khan Academy, again, you know, mastery learning is our cornerstone. It's not about time, it's
really about the learning that's happening. And so it's difficult to say, you know, give you an exact amount of time. However, what our research has shown is that it typically
takes students anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per
week to reach that minimum of two skills to proficiency. So, you know, you wanna
think about, again, everybody learns at a different
pace and there may be skills that, you know, they're much
more adept in than others. So a good timeframe to have in your mind is providing opportunities
for 30 to 60 minutes per week. And again, that can look a
variety of different ways. It can be assigned as
independent classwork, it can be assigned as homework, but definitely giving
students an an opportunity to engage weekly on the platform. All right, before I move on, are there any questions in
the chat, Jennifer Aviv, that we should address whole group? - [Jennifer] No, we're good at this time. Thank you, Francis.
- Awesome, excellent. Okay, so with that, I wanna go ahead and dive into these special teacher resources that are part of the Texas TEKS courses. You can access them right
here from the home dashboard under Check out our teacher resources. You can also access them at the very end of the left-hand nav menu
here under Teacher resources. And once you select that,
it's going to take you to this landing page,
which is going to give you a guide on how to use the
teacher guides, right? But it's also going to give you access to these downloadable and printable guides that are organized by unit, right? So I'm gonna go ahead and open up Unit 1, Extending whole number operations. It gives you the standards that this guide is going to cover. Once you click on that PDF, it is going to provide you
with objectives, strategies. It's gonna give you common misconceptions. It's gonna link you out to
any that are referenced. Once we scroll down into the
actual unit resources, right, and again, these are all
going to align to the content that's on Khan, so it's
going to tell you here not only the objective
and the teaching tips to help you as your lesson
planning and as you're delivering this instruction in your whole group, but it's also going to
tell you how many videos are available, how many
articles, and how many exercises to support that particular
lesson and standard. And you're also going to have
a Best practices section. It's going to walk you through
with very specific examples as well as like verbiage on
how to think through this, teach this, support
this in your classroom, and give you also links to additional general implementation resources
that you can use to support these standards and this
unit and these lessons in your classroom. So I'm going to go ahead and go back here. I'm gonna go ahead and
just select this unit just so that, again, you can kind of see how it's structured. So now instead of seeing all
the boxes for all the skills and the entire course,
which are 161 skills, you see that information here
underneath Grade 5 Texas TEKS, again, all the courses will have that, now I'm only seeing for that specific unit how many skills are available. So here students would work through these three and then have a quiz after those exercises,
right, for that skill. Then they're gonna work
through this skill. There's two exercises and
then they'll take a quiz. And that is how it's repeated, right? These little lightning
icons represent quizzes after each skill. And at the very end of the unit, they're gonna take the unit test, which is going to give them questions from each of the skills
that they worked through in the unit. Again, the really great
thing about Khan is that you, as the teacher, have the
flexibility to assign course mastery goals. So if you want to, you know,
make sure that the students have a goal to get
through the whole course by the end of the year, you can do that. You can assign by unit if you wanna chunk the material for
them and have it aligned to your scope and sequence. Because maybe unit one for
you is going to be something that you're teaching in January. So that's okay, you can assign
these units out of order, however they best fit with
your scope and sequence and what you're doing in the
classroom to help support you. You're always gonna have
access to the Assign button. From there, you're gonna be able to assign at the class level. So if you wanna assign it to all students, or if you wanna assign it to
a select group of students, you're also able to do that. And you're able to, with anything, also give specific due dates. And that's what would
create that assignment so that the students
then see that information on their dashboards when
they log in as students. All right. Let's see. From here, I'm gonna go ahead and go back. One thing that here, like I said, you can assign the course. Again, you would be able
to select your class and your students. There's a way that you can
provide a link to students so that students can link their accounts to your class. And with that, some of
the additional benefits of adding that information
is that you will get data, and you will get information
on how your students are doing based on things that you
have assigned to your class and to your students. All right, so we're gonna go ahead now and shift over to Khanmigo. Very, very excited to share
with you all things Khanmigo, because this is the new
AI-powered teaching assistant that has been integrated into Khan Academy to help support you as teachers in not only instructional pieces, but also administrative
tasks that we know teachers are asked to do as part of
their everyday workload. So we're gonna look at different ways that you can leverage
Khanmigo to help you. So there's a couple of ways
that you can access Khanmigo. I'm going to show you first one way, and then we will look at the second way that you can do that. The first way is Khanmigo is
always going to be hovering here on the lower right-hand corner anywhere you are in the platform, right? So if you wake Khanmigo
up and initiate Khanmigo from one of our courses or
from somewhere in the platform, it is going to automatically
know where you are, right? So the prompts that it's going to give you are going to be specific to wherever you are on the platform. So I'm going to say that
I'm in Algebraic reasoning. I know that this is coming up. I'm trying to kind of
think through what to do. I can open Khanmigo and I can go ahead and ask it questions directly, or I can use one of
these automated prompts, and Khanmigo will go ahead
and give me information based on what I ask it. One thing that I wanna point
out, a couple of things, here you're going to see this battery. Right now, it says that I'm at 95%. I've been using it quite a bit today. Khanmigo does run on
something called AI tokens. And so there it is sort
of like a battery, right? There's a 24-hour limit. We've never seen the battery run out, at least not up to this point. And we work with Khanmigo every day. But just in case, we wanna just make sure that you guys are aware of that. And it's like Cinderella. It resets nightly. So no worries. If you're ever low, it's okay. The next day you're back to 100%. The other thing that I
want to point out for you are these Leave feedback buttons. You can either leave as a
thumbs up or a thumbs down, and that'll be the end of that. Or you can click on where
it says Leave feedback, and you can be a little bit more detailed with the type of feedback
that you provide. This, there's actually
somebody on our team that this is her job, is
to analyze this feedback. So this does not go somewhere
in a cloud or to a robot or something that nobody ever sees. Like, this feedback actually
goes to a human person, you know, at the Khan Academy team whose job is to make sure
that we are making, you know, improvements and that
we're constantly ensuring that Khanmigo is doing
what it needs to do. So please, you know, don't
ever hesitate to reach out to us via the Leave feedback. Now I wanna go ahead and go
into an actual lesson, right? So here I'm in Understanding factor pairs, again, I can open up Khanmigo. As you can see now that
I'm in a specific skill, Khanmigo's prompts have changed. Now Khanmigo is giving me the option to summarize this video,
help me explain this video, suggest an engaging activity
that will pair with this skill, or help me write a lesson plan. Or again, I can ask it any
open-ended question that I want. However, there are also
other things you can do. You can come here to the very, very top where it says Assign, Lesson
Hook, Exit Ticket, Lesson Plan, and then there's even an
option for More Tools. And what we've done here
is we've already put front and center the tools
that we know teachers use the most when engaging
with specific exercises and skills lessons, right? So most of the time
teachers want to be able to create a lesson hook for
a lesson or an exit ticket or a lesson plan specific
to this standard and skill. So you can automatically
write from that specific skill or lesson, click on Lesson Hook, and it's going to already populate for you the information from that
particular skill or lesson that you were in. And you can go ahead and click
on Write some lesson hooks, and Khanmigo is going to go ahead and provide three different
ideas for you to use as a lesson hook for
understanding factor pairs. Now of course, you are the
teacher. This is an assistant. This is a resource for you. If there is something that
you don't like about this or it didn't really, you know, fit with what you were wanting, you are able to interact
with Khanmigo, right? So you can click here
to the little purple, it'll highlight that section,
and you can ask Khanmigo. You can say, ""Make changes to this."" And you can tell Khanmigo
what kind of changes you want it to make. Or you can say, ""No, I
don't like this at all. Go ahead and, you know,
give me a different idea, give me something else."" Or you can discuss this with Khanmigo, maybe you have questions about it, right? You can go ahead and
open up the discuss this and discuss it with Khanmigo. You can also make
changes directly on here. ""I want to add an extension to this."" So you can go ahead and make
changes. You can delete. This is for you to make it your own. Once you're happy with whatever
you have, you can print it. You have the option to
print any of the resources that you get from the Khanmigo tools. You can also export, you can
export to a Microsoft Word, you can export to a PDF. You can save it to Google Drive, and you can also save it
to Microsoft OneDrive. In addition to that, there's
like a cloud built in, it's called My Documents. And it will save anything
that you do on Khanmigo tools here as well for you to
access in the future. So there's multiple ways that you can save anything that you do with Khanmigo. Now going to go ahead and
show you this Lesson Plan tool live because this is
another very popular tool. Again, I'm opening it directly from a particular skill or lesson, so it's gonna already auto-populate that. But you will see here shortly
where you can put anything that you want on here and it
will give you a lesson plan. And I'll show you how to do
that here in a few minutes. Now with the Lesson Plan tool, I want you guys to think
of this as a buffet. When we go to a buffet,
there is absolutely no way that we can try and eat every single thing that's in the buffet because there's just so,
so, so many options, right? We typically go, we look
at what's available, and we select what we want and what is the most appetizing for us. Same thing with the
Lesson Plan tool, right? It's always going to give
you a very robust plan. You're going to have lots and
lots of things to choose from. Again, you are able to
interact with Khanmigo at any point with whatever you've selected that you wanna interact with it for. You're able to delete, you're able to add, you're able to print,
export, save to the cloud, all of those great things. You're always going to have the objective. It's going to give you activities
in the form of warmups, direct instruction. It's also going to give
you guided practice. It's going to give you
independent practice. It's going to give you exit ticket ideas. It's also going to give
you differentiation for, here, it gave me differentiation
for advanced learners, striving learners. Maybe I have a lot of
emergent bilingual students in my class. I can go ahead and, you
know, ask it to give me, ""Give me ideas to support English learners."" Whoops. And so Khanmigo will go ahead and, or actually, I didn't
highlight the whole thing, so I needed to highlight. Khanmigo is going to go ahead
and give me support for that. So what you want, there it is. There's the support for English learners. And the more information
you can give Khanmigo, the more refined and detailed it can be. And that's something that you will learn as you start using the tools. You also have here notable definitions, extension activities. It gives you links to ways
that you can extend learning for students, things that you can go ahead and directly assign to your students. And then it gives you a lesson summary. So that's an example of
the Lesson Plan tool. Now remember I said that
you could access Khanmigo two different ways,
directly from the content with the little Khanmigo
icon at the bottom right. But you can also come
here to the very top menu where it says Khanmigo and you
would click on Teacher tools. And it's going to default here to all the tools available. This can be a little bit overwhelming. So we're gonna go ahead and
chunk this out a little bit. I want us to look at these
categories up at the top. So we have tools in purple that are going to specifically support your planning. We have tools, color coded in green, that are going to specifically support when you're having to create things. Like for example, maybe you
wanna do a class newsletter. This is one of my favorite ones, especially because it will
translate the newsletter for you, definitely in Spanish and Portuguese, 'cause Khanmigo is trilingual
in Portuguese and Spanish. And let's just say he's
conversational in other languages, so you may be able to
get some translations in other languages. However, the Spanish and Portuguese are gonna be the ones that
are gonna have that accuracy to where you could send without errors. Here, you would, give
the name of your class, you know, you could just quickly paste or put something in about
what you did last week, what's coming up next week. I'm just gonna say, you
know, something very quickly. Obviously the more details you put, the better it is going to be. And then maybe I'm gonna put here, or I wanna do a field trip reminder. It'll write the newsletter. And again, you would be
able to translate from here. You would be able to
export, print directly, or save it to your preferred method. With the Create tools, you also have things like
letters of recommendations if we have any high school
teachers on the webinar. I know that that's something
that can be quite popular in the spring with some of your, or fall in the spring with
some of your students. You can generate multiple choice quizzes, English teachers, science teachers, any project-based
learning, rubric generator. This rubric generator will go ahead and create a rubric for you
based on what you give it. You're also able to, especially, again, supporting your emergent
bilingual students or maybe students that have an IEP in certain accommodations. Clear Directions is another great tool to help support that. Here, with these red tools,
you have the differentiation. You can chunk text. Leveler will adjust the
complexity of any given text. We've tried it out, I've
tried it out with, you know, things as complex as the
Declaration of Independence to, you know, short stories, poems, et cetera. So Leveler is another one. Make it Relevant, here's
one that I have put as a favorite of mine because, you know, we're always trying to connect
and build relationships with our students in our classrooms. So here you can go ahead and, you know, put in your standard or your objective or whatever it is that
you're going to be teaching. And then, you know, using
maybe like a class intro survey or what you already know about your class, you can say, you know, let's see, maybe that your class is
really into the Dallas Cowboys. I don't know, I mean, I
feel like the Dallas Cowboys have lost popularity lately. And then it will go
ahead and connect, right, that skill or that concept
of linear equations with the Dallas Cowboys
so that you're able to, you know, hook and engage
your students accordingly. All right, let's see. Support, these blue tools help
support this IEP Assistant. Here's another example of the way that, you know, you could
again, leverage Khanmigo to help support your ARD meetings or help support you in
preparation for ARD meetings. Again, this is not meant to replace you or replace what you are
writing, but simply to help. Because remember, you know,
Khanmigo may have access to research and ideas that maybe we as an ARD committee do not. So it will never ask for any kind of identifying information on a student. But basically by providing
information on these prompts, you would be able to get recommendations and suggestions for Khanmigo
that may be something you may find helpful to incorporate into a student's 504 plan or IEP. SMART Goal Writer, this
I would highly recommend as you're creating your T-test goals. This could help support
you in writing those. And here with Learn you
have Refresh My Knowledge. And with Refresh My
Knowledge, if maybe you're new to the grade level, new
to the content area, new to teaching, Khanmigo
can kind of help you refresh, you know, the knowledge for maybe teaching that linear equations lesson. So this is Khanmigo. I'm gonna go ahead and pause
in case there are any questions that have come in or
anybody has any questions that they'd like to drop in the chat before we go back to our slides. - [Jennifer] We're all
good, Francis. Thank you. - Thank you. All right. So now we would like to wrap up with some ideas for implementation. So here you have sort of a matrix on good, better, and best ways
to implement Khan Academy. As a reminder, you know, those
two skills too proficient per week is what we really want, you know, to aim for for students. You know, some schools
may encourage students to go through the course on their own, and you know, like at home as homework, during maybe advisory or WIN. Others and other teachers
may decide to incorporate and integrate Khan and have
it, you know, in the classroom and have it be a part
of like structured time that's given to students. You know, we have found that
the most effective approach includes completing the course challenges because that's going to
kind of give you a baseline and the student a
baseline of where they are for that course. Again, that's recommended
three times per year, beginning, middle, end. Setting those mastery goal, again, you can set it at the course level, right? Assign the course because
you want the students to work through the content of that course throughout the school year. Or you can decide to set, in addition to a course mastery goal, you also could set unit goals, right, that align to your scope and sequence. You wanna always, you
know, encourage students to track their progress
and for them to understand, you know, what they're working towards. In our dashboard, actually, I'm gonna go ahead and
quickly just go back because I wanna share with you that you do have access to, you do have access to printable resources that you can use to
leverage the implementation. So here under, whoops, excuse me, in your main dashboard, in your main teacher
dashboard, you are able to, I think I just froze my... Trying to switch over. You have access to resources, and right here under Resources. This is where you would
access the documents for Khanmigo that we
talked about, that cloud. You also have access to all
of these printable resources and they're organized by topic for you. And then if you are wanting to learn more about how to get started for Khan, you also have this Getting
started with Khan for Educators that will show you how to add
courses, how to add goals, how to, you know, look at
your reports and the data. And you also have this
Khanmigo for Educators where you can get certified. You'll get a certificate
at the end of that course so that you are able to
leverage that as well. All right, so I'm gonna go ahead and switch back to the slide. And I know that we've been monitoring the chat for questions. If there's no questions at this time, I'm gonna go ahead and leave you all with our social media and
our help center information. We have lots and lots of blog articles that you can type in a question and it should take you to how-tos and directions on how to do things, in addition to those self-paced
courses that I showed you, you could also access on the platform. We'd love to have you also join our Khan Academy Facebook group. So that link is available
for you there as well. And the last link is a blog article that has
videos specific to Khanmigo and Khanmigo teacher tools
that you're able to access. They're very brief, short and engaging and will help you use Khanmigo. All right, that is our presentation. We hope that this was
helpful for all of you. And we look forward to
continuing our partnership and continuing to be
able to provide educators and teachers with resources
that can hopefully help both students and teachers. Thank you so much. I hope you have a wonderful
rest of your evening. Take care. Bye-bye.",Integration of Khan Academy in Classrooms,Provides practical advice and examples on how teachers can integrate Khan Academy into their existing instruction to complement and enhance student learning.,00:04:30 - 00:05:30,2024-09-26T20:47:55Z,4790,76,4
