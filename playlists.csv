We want to make English work for you!

In this course you'll learn about:

1. The English parts of speech
2. Punctuation marks and how to use them
3. Style concepts like irony and understatement

This course covers a particular kind of English called Standard American English. It's not the only kind of English there is, but it's what we're qualified to teach. We want you to master this dialect while still recognizing that all varieties of English are equally valid, cool, and important.

This course covers elementary through high school grammarâ€”so whether you're just starting out or you'd like to refresh your knowledge, there's something for everyone in Khan Academy Grammar.

This we believe: you're a grammarian, and you can learn anything.",118
